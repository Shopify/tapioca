# This code rewrites RBS comments back into Sorbet's signatures as the files are being loaded.
# This will allow `sorbet-runtime` to wrap the methods as if they were originally written with the `sig{}` blocks.
# This will in turn allow Tapioca to use this signatures to generate typed RBI files.

  # When in a `bootsnap` environment, files are loaded from the cache and won't trigger the `source_transform` method.
  # The `require-hooks` gem comes with a `bootsnap` mode that will disable the `bootsnap/compile_cache/iseq` caching.
  # Sadly, we're way to early in the boot process to use it as bootsnap won't be loaded yet and the `require-hooks`
  # setup won't pick it up.
  #
  # As a workaround, if we can preemptively require `bootsnap` and `bootsnap/compile_cache/iseq` we manually override
  # the `load_iseq` method to disable the caching mechanism.
  #
  # This will make the Rails app load slower but allows us to trigger the RBS -> RBI source transform.
