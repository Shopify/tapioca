Tapioca makes it easy to work with [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org) in your codebase.
It surfaces types and methods from many sources that Sorbet cannot otherwise see – such as gems,
Rails and other DSLs – compiles them into [RBI files](https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi) and makes it easy for you to add
gradual typing to your application.
