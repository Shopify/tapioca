# Generic connection pool class for sharing a limited number of objects or network connections
# among many threads.  Note: pool elements are lazily created.
#
# Example usage with block (faster):
#
#    @pool = ConnectionPool.new { Redis.new }
#    @pool.with do |redis|
#      redis.lpop('my-list') if redis.llen('my-list') > 0
#    end
#
# Using optional timeout override (for that single invocation)
#
#    @pool.with(timeout: 2.0) do |redis|
#      redis.lpop('my-list') if redis.llen('my-list') > 0
#    end
#
# Example usage replacing an existing connection (slower):
#
#    $redis = ConnectionPool.wrap { Redis.new }
#
#    def do_work
#      $redis.lpop('my-list') if $redis.llen('my-list') > 0
#    end
#
# Accepts the following options:
# - :size - number of connections to pool, defaults to 5
# - :timeout - amount of time to wait for a connection if none currently available, defaults to 5 seconds
# - :auto_reload_after_fork - automatically drop all connections after fork, defaults to true

  # Marks the current thread's checked-out connection for discard.
  #
  # When a connection is marked for discard, it will not be returned to the pool
  # when checked in. Instead, the connection will be discarded.
  # This is useful when a connection has become invalid or corrupted
  # and should not be reused.
  #
  # Takes an optional block that will be called with the connection to be discarded.
  # The block should perform any necessary clean-up on the connection.
  #
  # Note: This only affects the connection currently checked out by the calling thread.
  # The connection will be discarded when +checkin+ is called.
  #
  # @example
  #   pool.with do |conn|
  #   begin
  #   conn.execute("SELECT 1")
  #   rescue SomeConnectionError
  #   pool.discard_current_connection  # Mark connection as bad
