# source://state_machines//lib/state_machines/eval_helpers.rb#8
module StateMachines::EvalHelpers
  # Evaluates one of several different types of methods within the context
  # of the given object.  Methods can be one of the following types:
  # * Symbol
  # * Method / Proc
  # * String
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  # Below are examples of the various ways that a method can be evaluated
  # on an object:
  #
  #   class Person
  #     def initialize(name)
  #       @name = name
  #     end
  #
  #     def name
  #       @name
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class PersonCallback
  #     def self.run(person)
  #       person.name
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   person = Person.new('John Smith')
  #
  #   evaluate_method(person, :name)                            # => "John Smith"
  #   evaluate_method(person, PersonCallback.method(:run))      # => "John Smith"
  #   evaluate_method(person, Proc.new {|person| person.name})  # => "John Smith"
  #   evaluate_method(person, lambda {|person| person.name})    # => "John Smith"
  #   evaluate_method(person, '@name')                          # => "John Smith"
  #
  # == Additional arguments
  #
  # Additional arguments can be passed to the methods being evaluated.  If
  # the method defines additional arguments other than the object context,
  # then all arguments are required.
  #
  # For guard conditions in state machines, event arguments can be passed
  # automatically based on the guard's arity:
  # - Guards with arity 1 receive only the object (backward compatible)
  # - Guards with arity -1 or > 1 receive object + event arguments
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   person = Person.new('John Smith')
  #
  #   evaluate_method(person, lambda {|person| person.name}, 21)                              # => "John Smith"
  #   evaluate_method(person, lambda {|person, age| "#{person.name} is #{age}"}, 21)          # => "John Smith is 21"
  #   evaluate_method(person, lambda {|person, age| "#{person.name} is #{age}"}, 21, 'male')  # => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 2)
  #
  # With event arguments for guards:
  #
  #   # Single parameter guard (backward compatible)
  #   guard = lambda {|obj| obj.valid? }
  #   evaluate_method_with_event_args(object, guard, [arg1, arg2])  # => calls guard.call(object)
  #
  #   # Multi-parameter guard (receives event args)
  #   guard = lambda {|obj, *args| obj.valid? && args[0] == :force }
  #   evaluate_method_with_event_args(object, guard, [:force])      # => calls guard.call(object, :force)
  #
  # source://state_machines//lib/state_machines/eval_helpers.rb#72
  def evaluate_method(object, method, *args, **_arg3, &block); end

  # Evaluates a guard method with support for event arguments passed to transitions.
  # This method uses arity detection to determine whether to pass event arguments
  # to the guard, ensuring backward compatibility.
  #
  # == Parameters
  # * object - The object context to evaluate within
  # * method - The guard method/proc to evaluate
  # * event_args - Array of arguments passed to the event (optional)
  #
  # == Arity-based behavior
  # * Arity 1: Only passes the object (backward compatible)
  # * Arity -1 or > 1: Passes object + event arguments
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  #   # Backward compatible single-parameter guard
  #   guard = lambda {|obj| obj.valid? }

  # * Before callbacks

  # * Invoke action

  #
  # For example, if two events (for state machines A and B) are run in
  # parallel, the order in which steps are run is:
  # * A - Before transition callbacks
  # * B - Before transition callbacks
  # * A - Persist new state

  # * A - Invoke action

  # be run in parallel.  If this is attempted, an ArgumentError will be
  # raised.
  #
  # == Halting callbacks
  #
  # When running multiple events in parallel, special consideration should
  # be taken with regard to how halting within callbacks affects the flow.
  #
  # For *before* callbacks, any <tt>:halt</tt> error that's thrown will
  # immediately cancel the perform for all transitions.  As a result, it's
  # possible for one event's transition to affect the continuation of
  # another.
  #
  # On the other hand, any <tt>:halt</tt> error that's thrown within an
  # *after* callback with only affect that event's transition.  Other
  # transitions will continue to run their own callbacks.

# Represents a state machine for a particular attribute.  State machines
# consist of states, events and a set of transitions that define how the
# state changes after a particular event is fired.
#
# A state machine will not know all of the possible states for an object
# unless they are referenced *somewhere* in the state machine definition.
# As a result, any unused states should be defined with the +other_states+
# or +state+ helper.
#
# == Actions
#
# When an action is configured for a state machine, it is invoked when an
# object transitions via an event.  The success of the event becomes
# dependent on the success of the action.  If the action is successful, then
# the transitioned state remains persisted.  However, if the action fails
# (by returning false), the transitioned state will be rolled back.
#
# For example,
#
#   class Vehicle
#     attr_accessor :fail, :saving_state
#
#     state_machine :initial => :parked, :action => :save do
#       event :ignite do
#         transition :parked => :idling
#       end
#
#       event :park do
#         transition :idling => :parked
#       end
#     end
#
#     def save
#       @saving_state = state
#       fail != true
#     end
#   end
#
#   vehicle = Vehicle.new     # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c27024 @state="parked">
#   vehicle.save              # => true
#   vehicle.saving_state      # => "parked" # The state was "parked" was save was called
#
#   # Successful event
#   vehicle.ignite            # => true
#   vehicle.saving_state      # => "idling" # The state was "idling" when save was called
#   vehicle.state             # => "idling"
#
#   # Failed event
#   vehicle.fail = true
#   vehicle.park              # => false
#   vehicle.saving_state      # => "parked"
#   vehicle.state             # => "idling"
#
# As shown, even though the state is set prior to calling the +save+ action
# on the object, it will be rolled back to the original state if the action
# fails.  *Note* that this will also be the case if an exception is raised
# while calling the action.
#
# === Indirect transitions
#
# In addition to the action being run as the _result_ of an event, the action
# can also be used to run events itself.  For example, using the above as an
# example:
#
#   vehicle = Vehicle.new           # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c27024 @state="parked">
#
#   vehicle.state_event = 'ignite'
#   vehicle.save                    # => true
#   vehicle.state                   # => "idling"
#   vehicle.state_event             # => nil
#
# As can be seen, the +save+ action automatically invokes the event stored in
# the +state_event+ attribute (<tt>:ignite</tt> in this case).
#
# One important note about using this technique for running transitions is
# that if the class in which the state machine is defined *also* defines the
# action being invoked (and not a superclass), then it must manually run the
# StateMachine hook that checks for event attributes.
#
# For example, in ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Mongoid, MongoMapper, and Sequel,
# the default action (+save+) is already defined in a base class.  As a result,
# when a state machine is defined in a model / resource, StateMachine can
# automatically hook into the +save+ action.
#
# On the other hand, the Vehicle class from above defined its own +save+
# method (and there is no +save+ method in its superclass).  As a result, it
# must be modified like so:
#
#     def save
#       self.class.state_machines.transitions(self, :save).perform do
#         @saving_state = state
#         fail != true
#       end
#     end
#
# This will add in the functionality for firing the event stored in the
# +state_event+ attribute.
#
# == Callbacks
#
# Callbacks are supported for hooking before and after every possible
# transition in the machine.  Each callback is invoked in the order in which
# it was defined.  See StateMachines::Machine#before_transition and
# StateMachines::Machine#after_transition for documentation on how to define
# new callbacks.
#
# *Note* that callbacks only get executed within the context of an event.  As
# a result, if a class has an initial state when it's created, any callbacks
# that would normally get executed when the object enters that state will
# *not* get triggered.
#
# For example,
#
#   class Vehicle
#     state_machine initial: :parked do
#       after_transition all => :parked do
#         raise ArgumentError
#       end
#       ...
#     end
#   end
#
#   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle id: 1, state: "parked">
#   vehicle.save            # => true (no exception raised)
#
# If you need callbacks to get triggered when an object is created, this
# should be done by one of the following techniques:
# * Use a <tt>before :create</tt> or equivalent hook:
#
#     class Vehicle
#       before :create, :track_initial_transition
#
#       state_machine do
#         ...
#       end
#     end
#
# * Set an initial state and use the correct event to create the
#   object with the proper state, resulting in callbacks being triggered and
#   the object getting persisted (note that the <tt>:pending</tt> state is
#   actually stored as nil):
#
#     class Vehicle
#        state_machine initial: :pending
#         after_transition pending: :parked, do: :track_initial_transition
#
#         event :park do
#           transition pending: :parked
#         end
#
#         state :pending, value: nil
#       end
#     end
#
#     vehicle = Vehicle.new
#     vehicle.park
#
# * Use a default event attribute that will automatically trigger when the
#   configured action gets run (note that the <tt>:pending</tt> state is
#   actually stored as nil):
#
#     class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
#       state_machine initial: :pending
#         after_transition pending: :parked, do: :track_initial_transition
#
#         event :park do
#           transition pending: :parked
#         end
#
#         state :pending, value: nil
#       end
#
#       def initialize(*)
#         super
#         self.state_event = 'park'
#       end
#     end
#
#     vehicle = Vehicle.new
#     vehicle.save
#
# === Canceling callbacks
#
# Callbacks can be canceled by throwing :halt at any point during the
# callback.  For example,
#
#   ...
#   throw :halt
#   ...
#
# If a +before+ callback halts the chain, the associated transition and all
# later callbacks are canceled.  If an +after+ callback halts the chain,
# the later callbacks are canceled, but the transition is still successful.
#
# These same rules apply to +around+ callbacks with the exception that any
# +around+ callback that doesn't yield will essentially result in :halt being
# thrown.  Any code executed after the yield will behave in the same way as
# +after+ callbacks.
#
# *Note* that if a +before+ callback fails and the bang version of an event
# was invoked, an exception will be raised instead of returning false.  For
# example,
#
#   class Vehicle
#     state_machine :initial => :parked do
#       before_transition any => :idling, :do => lambda {|vehicle| throw :halt}
#       ...
#     end
#   end
#
#   vehicle = Vehicle.new
#   vehicle.park        # => false
#   vehicle.park!       # => StateMachines::InvalidTransition: Cannot transition state via :park from "idling"
#
# == Observers
#
# Observers, in the sense of external classes and *not* Ruby's Observable
# mechanism, can hook into state machines as well.  Such observers use the
# same callback api that's used internally.
#
# Below are examples of defining observers for the following state machine:
#
#   class Vehicle
#     state_machine do
#       event :park do
#         transition idling: :parked
#       end
#       ...
#     end
#     ...
#   end
#
# Event/Transition behaviors:
#
#   class VehicleObserver
#     def self.before_park(vehicle, transition)
#       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to park... state is: #{transition.from}, state will be: #{transition.to}"
#     end
#
#     def self.after_park(vehicle, transition, result)
#       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to park... state was: #{transition.from}, state is: #{transition.to}"
#     end
#
#     def self.before_transition(vehicle, transition)
#       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to #{transition.event}... #{transition.attribute} is: #{transition.from}, #{transition.attribute} will be: #{transition.to}"
#     end
#
#     def self.after_transition(vehicle, transition)
#       logger.info "#{vehicle} instructed to #{transition.event}... #{transition.attribute} was: #{transition.from}, #{transition.attribute} is: #{transition.to}"
#     end
#
#     def self.around_transition(vehicle, transition)
#       logger.info Benchmark.measure { yield }
#     end
#   end
#
#   Vehicle.state_machine do
#     before_transition :on => :park, :do => VehicleObserver.method(:before_park)
#     before_transition VehicleObserver.method(:before_transition)
#
#     after_transition :on => :park, :do => VehicleObserver.method(:after_park)
#     after_transition VehicleObserver.method(:after_transition)
#
#     around_transition VehicleObserver.method(:around_transition)
#   end
#
# One common callback is to record transitions for all models in the system
# for auditing/debugging purposes.  Below is an example of an observer that
# can easily automate this process for all models:
#
#   class StateMachineObserver
#     def self.before_transition(object, transition)
#       Audit.log_transition(object.attributes)
#     end
#   end
#
#   [Vehicle, Switch, Project].each do |klass|
#     klass.state_machines.each do |attribute, machine|
#       machine.before_transition StateMachineObserver.method(:before_transition)
#     end
#   end
#
# Additional observer-like behavior may be exposed by the various integrations
# available.  See below for more information on integrations.
#
# == Overriding instance / class methods
#
# Hooking in behavior to the generated instance / class methods from the
# state machine, events, and states is very simple because of the way these
# methods are generated on the class.  Using the class's ancestors, the
# original generated method can be referred to via +super+.  For example,
#
#   class Vehicle
#     state_machine do
#       event :park do
#         ...
#       end
#     end
#
#     def park(*args)
#       logger.info "..."
#       super
#     end
#   end
#
# In the above example, the +park+ instance method that's generated on the
# Vehicle class (by the associated event) is overridden with custom behavior.
# Once this behavior is complete, the original method from the state machine
# is invoked by simply calling +super+.
#
# The same technique can be used for +state+, +state_name+, and all other
# instance *and* class methods on the Vehicle class.
#
# == Method conflicts
#
# By default state_machine does not redefine methods that exist on
# superclasses (*including* Object) or any modules (*including* Kernel) that
# were included before it was defined.  This is in order to ensure that
# existing behavior on the class is not broken by the inclusion of
# state_machine.
#
# If a conflicting method is detected, state_machine will generate a warning.
# For example, consider the following class:
#
#   class Vehicle
#     state_machine do
#       event :open do
#         ...
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# In the above class, an event named "open" is defined for its state machine.
# However, "open" is already defined as an instance method in Ruby's Kernel
# module that gets included in every Object.  As a result, state_machine will
# generate the following warning:
#
#   Instance method "open" is already defined in Object, use generic helper instead or set StateMachines::Machine.ignore_method_conflicts = true.
#
# Even though you may not be using Kernel's implementation of the "open"
# instance method, state_machine isn't aware of this and, as a result, stays
# safe and just skips redefining the method.
#
# As with almost all helpers methods defined by state_machine in your class,
# there are generic methods available for working around this method conflict.
# In the example above, you can invoke the "open" event like so:
#
#   vehicle = Vehicle.new       # => #<Vehicle:0xb72686b4 @state=nil>
#   vehicle.fire_events(:open)  # => true
#
#   # This will not work
#   vehicle.open                # => NoMethodError: private method `open' called for #<Vehicle:0xb72686b4 @state=nil>
#
# If you want to take on the risk of overriding existing methods and just
# ignore method conflicts altogether, you can do so by setting the following
# configuration:
#
#   StateMachines::Machine.ignore_method_conflicts = true
#
# This will allow you to define events like "open" as described above and
# still generate the "open" instance helper method.  For example:
#
#   StateMachines::Machine.ignore_method_conflicts = true
#
#   class Vehicle
#     state_machine do
#       event :open do
#         ...
#     end
#   end
#
#   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle:0xb72686b4 @state=nil>
#   vehicle.open            # => true
#
# By default, state_machine helps prevent you from making mistakes and
# accidentally overriding methods that you didn't intend to.  Once you
# understand this and what the consequences are, setting the
# +ignore_method_conflicts+ option is a perfectly reasonable workaround.
#
# == Integrations
#
# By default, state machines are library-agnostic, meaning that they work
# on any Ruby class and have no external dependencies.  However, there are
# certain libraries which expose additional behavior that can be taken
# advantage of by state machines.
#
# This library is built to work out of the box with a few popular Ruby
# libraries that allow for additional behavior to provide a cleaner and
# smoother experience.  This is especially the case for objects backed by a
# database that may allow for transactions, persistent storage,
# search/filters, callbacks, etc.
#
# When a state machine is defined for classes using any of the above libraries,
# it will try to automatically determine the integration to use (Agnostic,
# ActiveModel, ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Mongoid, MongoMapper, or Sequel)
# based on the class definition.  To see how each integration affects the
# machine's behavior, refer to all constants defined under the
# StateMachines::Integrations namespace.

  # In any of these cases, any failure callback that matches the attempted

  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       after_failure do |vehicle, transition|
  #         logger.error "vehicle #{vehicle} failed to transition on #{transition.event}"

  def after_transition(*args, **options, &_arg2); end

  # Creates a callback that will be invoked *around* a transition so long as
  # the given requirements match the transition.
  #
  # == The callback
  #
  # Around callbacks wrap transitions, executing code both before and after.
  # These callbacks are defined in the exact same manner as before / after
  # callbacks with the exception that the transition must be yielded to in
  # order to finish running it.
  #
  # If defining +around+ callbacks using blocks, you must yield within the
  # transition by directly calling the block (since yielding is not allowed
  # within blocks).
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       around_transition do |block|
  #         Benchmark.measure { block.call }
  #       end
  #
  #       around_transition do |vehicle, block|
  #         logger.info "vehicle was #{state}..."
  #         block.call
  #         logger.info "...and is now #{state}"
  #       end
  #
  #       around_transition do |vehicle, transition, block|
  #         logger.info "before #{transition.event}: #{vehicle.state}"
  #         block.call
  #         logger.info "after #{transition.event}: #{vehicle.state}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Notice that referencing the block is similar to doing so within an
  # actual method definition in that it is always the last argument.
  #
  # On the other hand, if you're defining +around+ callbacks using method
  # references, you can yield like normal:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       around_transition :benchmark
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     def benchmark
  #       Benchmark.measure { yield }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # See +before_transition+ for a description of the possible configurations
  # for defining callbacks.
  #
  # source://state_machines//lib/state_machines/machine.rb#1445
  def around_transition(*args, **options, &_arg2); end

  # Creates a callback that will be invoked *before* a transition is
  # performed so long as the given requirements match the transition.
  #
  # == The callback
  #
  # Callbacks must be defined as either an argument, in the :do option, or
  # as a block.  For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       before_transition :set_alarm
  #       before_transition :set_alarm, all => :parked
  #       before_transition all => :parked, :do => :set_alarm
  #       before_transition all => :parked do |vehicle, transition|
  #         vehicle.set_alarm
  #       end
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Notice that the first three callbacks are the same in terms of how the
  # methods to invoke are defined.  However, using the <tt>:do</tt> can
  # provide for a more fluid DSL.
  #
  # In addition, multiple callbacks can be defined like so:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       before_transition :set_alarm, :lock_doors, all => :parked
  #       before_transition all => :parked, :do => [:set_alarm, :lock_doors]
  #       before_transition :set_alarm do |vehicle, transition|
  #         vehicle.lock_doors
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Notice that the different ways of configuring methods can be mixed.
  #
  # == State requirements
  #
  # Callbacks can require that the machine be transitioning from and to
  # specific states.  These requirements use a Hash syntax to map beginning
  # states to ending states.  For example,
  #
  #   before_transition :parked => :idling, :idling => :first_gear, :do => :set_alarm
  #
  # In this case, the +set_alarm+ callback will only be called if the machine
  # is transitioning from +parked+ to +idling+ or from +idling+ to +parked+.
  #
  # To help define state requirements, a set of helpers are available for
  # slightly more complex matching:
  # * <tt>all</tt> - Matches every state/event in the machine
  # * <tt>all - [:parked, :idling, ...]</tt> - Matches every state/event except those specified
  # * <tt>any</tt> - An alias for +all+ (matches every state/event in the machine)
  # * <tt>same</tt> - Matches the same state being transitioned from
  #
  # See StateMachines::MatcherHelpers for more information.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   before_transition :parked => [:idling, :first_gear], :do => ...     # Matches from parked to idling or first_gear
  #   before_transition all - [:parked, :idling] => :idling, :do => ...   # Matches from every state except parked and idling to idling
  #   before_transition all => :parked, :do => ...                        # Matches all states to parked
  #   before_transition any => same, :do => ...                           # Matches every loopback
  #
  # == Event requirements
  #
  # In addition to state requirements, an event requirement can be defined so
  # that the callback is only invoked on specific events using the +on+
  # option.  This can also use the same matcher helpers as the state
  # requirements.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   before_transition :on => :ignite, :do => ...                        # Matches only on ignite
  #   before_transition :on => all - :ignite, :do => ...                  # Matches on every event except ignite
  #   before_transition :parked => :idling, :on => :ignite, :do => ...    # Matches from parked to idling on ignite
  #
  # == Verbose Requirements
  #
  # Requirements can also be defined using verbose options rather than the
  # implicit Hash syntax and helper methods described above.
  #
  # Configuration options:
  # * <tt>:from</tt> - One or more states being transitioned from.  If none
  #   are specified, then all states will match.
  # * <tt>:to</tt> - One or more states being transitioned to.  If none are
  #   specified, then all states will match.
  # * <tt>:on</tt> - One or more events that fired the transition.  If none
  #   are specified, then all events will match.
  # * <tt>:except_from</tt> - One or more states *not* being transitioned from
  # * <tt>:except_to</tt> - One more states *not* being transitioned to
  # * <tt>:except_on</tt> - One or more events that *did not* fire the transition
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   before_transition :from => :ignite, :to => :idling, :on => :park, :do => ...
  #   before_transition :except_from => :ignite, :except_to => :idling, :except_on => :park, :do => ...
  #
  # == Conditions
  #
  # In addition to the state/event requirements, a condition can also be
  # defined to help determine whether the callback should be invoked.
  #
  # Configuration options:
  # * <tt>:if</tt> - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the
  #   callback should occur (e.g. :if => :allow_callbacks, or
  #   :if => lambda {|user| user.signup_step > 2}). The method, proc or string
  #   should return or evaluate to a true or false value.
  # * <tt>:unless</tt> - A method, proc or string to call to determine if the
  #   callback should not occur (e.g. :unless => :skip_callbacks, or
  #   :unless => lambda {|user| user.signup_step <= 2}). The method, proc or
  #   string should return or evaluate to a true or false value.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   before_transition :parked => :idling, :if => :moving?, :do => ...
  #   before_transition :on => :ignite, :unless => :seatbelt_on?, :do => ...
  #
  # == Accessing the transition
  #
  # In addition to passing the object being transitioned, the actual
  # transition describing the context (e.g. event, from, to) can be accessed
  # as well.  This additional argument is only passed if the callback allows
  # for it.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     # Only specifies one parameter (the object being transitioned)
  #     before_transition all => :parked do |vehicle|
  #       vehicle.set_alarm
  #     end
  #
  #     # Specifies 2 parameters (object being transitioned and actual transition)
  #     before_transition all => :parked do |vehicle, transition|
  #       vehicle.set_alarm(transition)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # *Note* that the object in the callback will only be passed in as an
  # argument if callbacks are configured to *not* be bound to the object
  # involved.  This is the default and may change on a per-integration basis.
  #
  # See StateMachines::Transition for more information about the
  # attributes available on the transition.
  #
  # == Usage with delegates
  #
  # As noted above, state_machine uses the callback method's argument list
  # arity to determine whether to include the transition in the method call.
  # If you're using delegates, such as those defined in ActiveSupport or
  # Forwardable, the actual arity of the delegated method gets masked.  This
  # means that callbacks which reference delegates will always get passed the
  # transition as an argument.  For example:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     extend Forwardable
  #     delegate :refresh => :dashboard
  #
  #     state_machine do
  #       before_transition :refresh
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     def dashboard
  #       @dashboard ||= Dashboard.new
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class Dashboard
  #     def refresh(transition)
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In the above example, <tt>Dashboard#refresh</tt> *must* defined a
  # +transition+ argument.  Otherwise, an +ArgumentError+ exception will get
  # raised.  The only way around this is to avoid the use of delegates and
  # manually define the delegate method so that the correct arity is used.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  # Below is an example of a class with one state machine and various types
  # of +before+ transitions defined for it:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       # Before all transitions
  #       before_transition :update_dashboard
  #
  #       # Before specific transition:
  #       before_transition [:first_gear, :idling] => :parked, :on => :park, :do => :take_off_seatbelt
  #
  #       # With conditional callback:
  #       before_transition all => :parked, :do => :take_off_seatbelt, :if => :seatbelt_on?
  #
  #       # Using helpers:
  #       before_transition all - :stalled => same, :on => any - :crash, :do => :update_dashboard
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # As can be seen, any number of transitions can be created using various
  # combinations of configuration options.

  def callbacks; end

  # Defines a new helper method in an instance or class scope with the given
  # name.  If the method is already defined in the scope, then this will not
  # override it.
  #
  # If passing in a block, there are two side effects to be aware of
  # 1. The method cannot be chained, meaning that the block cannot call +super+
  # 2. If the method is already defined in an ancestor, then it will not get
  #    overridden and a warning will be output.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   # Instance helper
  #   machine.define_helper(:instance, :state_name) do |machine, object|
  #     machine.states.match(object).name
  #   end
  #
  #   # Class helper
  #   machine.define_helper(:class, :state_machine_name) do |machine, klass|
  #     "State"
  #   end
  #
  # You can also define helpers using string evaluation like so:
  #
  #   # Instance helper
  #   machine.define_helper :instance, <<-end_eval, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
  #     def state_name
  #       self.class.state_machine(:state).states.match(self).name

  #   # Class helper
  #   machine.define_helper :class, <<-end_eval, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1

  #
  # Configuration options:
  # * <tt>:attribute</tt> - The name of the attribute to store the state value
  #   in.  By default, this is the same as the name of the machine.
  # * <tt>:initial</tt> - The initial state of the attribute. This can be a
  #   static state or a lambda block which will be evaluated at runtime
  #   (e.g. lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.speed == 0 ? :parked : :idling}).
  #   Default is nil.
  # * <tt>:initialize</tt> - Whether to automatically initialize the attribute
  #   by hooking into #initialize on the owner class.  Default is true.
  # * <tt>:action</tt> - The instance method to invoke when an object
  #   transitions. Default is nil unless otherwise specified by the
  #   configured integration.
  # * <tt>:namespace</tt> - The name to use for namespacing all generated
  #   state / event instance methods (e.g. "heater" would generate
  #   :turn_on_heater and :turn_off_heater for the :turn_on/:turn_off events).
  #   Default is nil.
  # * <tt>:integration</tt> - The name of the integration to use for adding
  #   library-specific behavior to the machine.  Built-in integrations
  #   include :active_model, :active_record, :data_mapper, :mongo_mapper, and
  #   :sequel.  By default, this is determined automatically.
  #
  # Configuration options relevant to ORM integrations:
  # * <tt>:plural</tt> - The pluralized version of the name.  By default, this
  #   will attempt to call +pluralize+ on the name.  If this method is not
  #   available, an "s" is appended.  This is used for generating scopes.
  # * <tt>:messages</tt> - The error messages to use when invalidating
  #   objects due to failed transitions.  Messages include:
  #   * <tt>:invalid</tt>
  #   * <tt>:invalid_event</tt>
  #   * <tt>:invalid_transition</tt>
  # * <tt>:use_transactions</tt> - Whether transactions should be used when
  #   firing events.  Default is true unless otherwise specified by the
  #   configured integration.
  #
  # This also expects a block which will be used to actually configure the
  # states, events and transitions for the state machine.  *Note* that this
  # block will be executed within the context of the state machine.  As a
  # result, you will not be able to access any class methods unless you refer
  # to them directly (i.e. specifying the class name).
  #
  # For examples on the types of state machine configurations and blocks, see
  # the section below.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  # With the default name/attribute and no configuration:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine do
  #       event :park do
  #         ...
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The above example will define a state machine named "state" that will
  # store the value in the +state+ attribute.  Every vehicle will start
  # without an initial state.
  #
  # With a custom name / attribute:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :status, :attribute => :status_value do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # With a static initial state:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :status, :initial => :parked do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # With a dynamic initial state:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :status, :initial => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.speed == 0 ? :parked : :idling} do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Class Methods
  #
  # The following class methods will be automatically generated by the
  # state machine based on the *name* of the machine.  Any existing methods
  # will not be overwritten.
  # * <tt>human_state_name(state)</tt> - Gets the humanized value for the
  #   given state.  This may be generated by internationalization libraries if
  #   supported by the integration.
  # * <tt>human_state_event_name(event)</tt> - Gets the humanized value for
  #   the given event.  This may be generated by internationalization
  #   libraries if supported by the integration.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition :parked => :idling
  #       end
  #
  #       event :shift_up do
  #         transition :idling => :first_gear
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   Vehicle.human_state_name(:parked)         # => "parked"
  #   Vehicle.human_state_name(:first_gear)     # => "first gear"
  #   Vehicle.human_state_event_name(:park)     # => "park"
  #   Vehicle.human_state_event_name(:shift_up) # => "shift up"
  #
  # == Instance Methods
  #
  # The following instance methods will be automatically generated by the
  # state machine based on the *name* of the machine.  Any existing methods
  # will not be overwritten.
  # * <tt>state</tt> - Gets the current value for the attribute
  # * <tt>state=(value)</tt> - Sets the current value for the attribute
  # * <tt>state?(name)</tt> - Checks the given state name against the current
  #   state.  If the name is not a known state, then an ArgumentError is raised.
  # * <tt>state_name</tt> - Gets the name of the state for the current value
  # * <tt>human_state_name</tt> - Gets the human-readable name of the state
  #   for the current value
  # * <tt>state_events(requirements = {})</tt> - Gets the list of events that
  #   can be fired on the current object's state (uses the *unqualified* event
  #   names)
  # * <tt>state_transitions(requirements = {})</tt> - Gets the list of
  #   transitions that can be made on the current object's state
  # * <tt>state_paths(requirements = {})</tt> - Gets the list of sequences of
  #   transitions that can be run from the current object's state
  # * <tt>fire_state_event(name, *args)</tt> - Fires an arbitrary event with
  #   the given argument list. This is essentially the same as calling the
  #   actual event method itself.
  #
  # The <tt>state_events</tt>, <tt>state_transitions</tt>, and <tt>state_paths</tt>
  # helpers all take an optional set of requirements for determining what's
  # available for the current object.  These requirements include:
  # * <tt>:from</tt> - One or more states to transition from.  If none are
  #   specified, then this will be the object's current state.
  # * <tt>:to</tt> - One or more states to transition to.  If none are
  #   specified, then this will match any to state.
  # * <tt>:on</tt> - One or more events to transition on.  If none are
  #   specified, then this will match any event.
  # * <tt>:guard</tt> - Whether to guard transitions with the if/unless
  #   conditionals defined for each one.  Default is true.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition :parked => :idling
  #       end
  #
  #       event :park do
  #         transition :idling => :parked
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
  #   vehicle.state                             # => "parked"
  #   vehicle.state_name                        # => :parked
  #   vehicle.human_state_name                  # => "parked"
  #   vehicle.state?(:parked)                   # => true

  #   # Changing state
  #   vehicle.state = 'idling'

  #
  #   # Fire arbitrary events
  #   vehicle.fire_state_event(:park)           # => true
  #
  # == Attribute initialization
  #
  # For most classes, the initial values for state machine attributes are
  # automatically assigned when a new object is created.  However, this
  # behavior will *not* work if the class defines an +initialize+ method
  # without properly calling +super+.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c8dbf8 @state="parked">
  #   vehicle.state           # => "parked"
  #
  # In the above example, no +initialize+ method is defined.  As a result,
  # the default behavior of initializing the state machine attributes is used.
  #
  # In the following example, a custom +initialize+ method is defined:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     def initialize
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c77678>
  #   vehicle.state           # => nil
  #
  # Since the +initialize+ method is defined, the state machine attributes
  # never get initialized.  In order to ensure that all initialization hooks
  # are called, the custom method *must* call +super+ without any arguments
  # like so:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     def initialize(attributes = {})
  #       ...
  #       super()
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c8dbf8 @state="parked">
  #   vehicle.state           # => "parked"
  #
  # Because of the way the inclusion of modules works in Ruby, calling
  # <tt>super()</tt> will not only call the superclass's +initialize+, but
  # also +initialize+ on all included modules.  This allows the original state
  # machine hook to get called properly.
  #
  # If you want to avoid calling the superclass's constructor, but still want
  # to initialize the state machine attributes:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     def initialize(attributes = {})
  #       ...
  #       initialize_state_machines
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c8dbf8 @state="parked">
  #   vehicle.state           # => "parked"
  #
  # You may also need to call the +initialize_state_machines+ helper manually
  # in cases where you want to change how static / dynamic initial states get
  # set.  For example, the following example forces the initialization of
  # static states regardless of their current value:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       state nil, :idling
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     def initialize(attributes = {})
  #       @state = 'idling'
  #       initialize_state_machines(:static => :force) do
  #         ...
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new   # => #<Vehicle:0xb7c8dbf8 @state="parked">
  #   vehicle.state           # => "parked"
  #
  # The above example is also noteworthy because it demonstrates how to avoid
  # initialization issues when +nil+ is a valid state.  Without passing in
  # <tt>:static => :force</tt>, state_machine would never have initialized
  # the state because +nil+ (the default attribute value) would have been
  # interpreted as a valid current state.  As a result, state_machine would
  # have simply skipped initialization.
  #
  # == States
  #
  # All of the valid states for the machine are automatically tracked based
  # on the events, transitions, and callbacks defined for the machine.  If
  # there are additional states that are never referenced, these should be
  # explicitly added using the StateMachines::Machine#state or
  # StateMachines::Machine#other_states helpers.
  #
  # When a new state is defined, a predicate method for that state is
  # generated on the class.  For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition all => :idling
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # ...will generate the following instance methods (assuming they're not
  # already defined in the class):
  # * <tt>parked?</tt>
  # * <tt>idling?</tt>
  #
  # Each predicate method will return true if it matches the object's
  # current state.  Otherwise, it will return false.
  #
  # == Attribute access
  #
  # The actual value for a state is stored in the attribute configured for the
  # state machine.  In most cases, this is the same as the name of the state
  # machine.  For example:
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     attr_accessor :state
  #
  #     state_machine :state, :initial => :parked do
  #       ...
  #       state :parked, :value => 0
  #       start :idling, :value => 1
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new # => #<Vehicle:0xb712da60 @state=0>
  #   vehicle.state         # => 0
  #   vehicle.parked?       # => true
  #   vehicle.state = 1
  #   vehicle.idling?       # => true
  #
  # The most important thing to note from the example above is what it means
  # to read from and write to the state machine's attribute.  In particular,
  # state_machine treats the attribute (+state+ in this case) like a basic
  # attr_accessor that's been defined on the class.  There are no special
  # behaviors added, such as allowing the attribute to be written to based on
  # the name of a state in the machine.  This is the case for a few reasons:
  # * Setting the attribute directly is an edge case that is meant to only be
  #   used when you want to skip state_machine altogether.  This means that
  #   state_machine shouldn't have any effect on the attribute accessor
  #   methods.  If you want to change the state, you should be using one of
  #   the events defined in the state machine.
  # * Many ORMs provide custom behavior for the attribute reader / writer - it
  #   may even be defined by your own framework / method implementation just
  #   the example above showed.  In order to avoid having to worry about the
  #   different ways an attribute can get written, state_machine just makes
  #   sure that the configured value for a state is always used when writing
  #   to the attribute.
  #
  # If you were interested in accessing the name of a state (instead of its
  # actual value through the attribute), you could do the following:
  #
  #   vehicle.state_name    # => :idling
  #
  # == Events and Transitions
  #
  # Events defined on the machine are the interface to transitioning states
  # for an object.  Events can be fired either directly (through the method
  # generated for the event) or indirectly (through attributes defined on
  # the machine).
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     include DataMapper::Resource
  #     property :id, Serial
  #
  #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
  #       event :ignite do
  #         transition :parked => :idling
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     state_machine :alarm_state, :initial => :active do
  #       event :disable do
  #         transition all => :off
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Fire +ignite+ event directly
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.create    # => #<Vehicle id=1 state="parked" alarm_state="active">
  #   vehicle.ignite              # => true
  #   vehicle.state               # => "idling"
  #   vehicle.alarm_state         # => "active"
  #
  #   # Fire +disable+ event automatically
  #   vehicle.alarm_state_event = 'disable'
  #   vehicle.save                # => true
  #   vehicle.alarm_state         # => "off"
  #
  # In the above example, the +state+ attribute is transitioned using the
  # +ignite+ action that's generated from the state machine.  On the other
  # hand, the +alarm_state+ attribute is transitioned using the +alarm_state_event+
  # attribute that automatically gets fired when the machine's action (+save+)
  # is invoked.
  #
  # For more information about how to configure an event and its associated
  # transitions, see StateMachines::Machine#event.
  #
  # == Defining callbacks
  #
  # Within the +state_machine+ block, you can also define callbacks for
  # transitions.  For more information about defining these callbacks,
  # see StateMachines::Machine#before_transition, StateMachines::Machine#after_transition,
  # and StateMachines::Machine#around_transition, and StateMachines::Machine#after_failure.
  #
  # == Namespaces
  #
  # When a namespace is configured for a state machine, the name provided
  # will be used in generating the instance methods for interacting with
  # states/events in the machine.  This is particularly useful when a class
  # has multiple state machines and it would be difficult to differentiate
  # between the various states / events.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   class Vehicle
  #     state_machine :heater_state, :initial => :off, :namespace => 'heater' do
  #       event :turn_on do
  #         transition all => :on
  #       end
  #
  #       event :turn_off do
  #         transition all => :off
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     state_machine :alarm_state, :initial => :active, :namespace => 'alarm' do
  #       event :turn_on do
  #         transition all => :active
  #       end
  #
  #       event :turn_off do
  #         transition all => :off
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The above class defines two state machines: +heater_state+ and +alarm_state+.
  # For the +heater_state+ machine, the following methods are generated since
  # it's namespaced by "heater":
  # * <tt>can_turn_on_heater?</tt>
  # * <tt>turn_on_heater</tt>
  # * ...
  # * <tt>can_turn_off_heater?</tt>
  # * <tt>turn_off_heater</tt>
  # * ..
  # * <tt>heater_off?</tt>
  # * <tt>heater_on?</tt>
  #
  # As shown, each method is unique to the state machine so that the states
  # and events don't conflict.  The same goes for the +alarm_state+ machine:
  # * <tt>can_turn_on_alarm?</tt>
  # * <tt>turn_on_alarm</tt>
  # * ...
  # * <tt>can_turn_off_alarm?</tt>
  # * <tt>turn_off_alarm</tt>
  # * ..
  # * <tt>alarm_active?</tt>
  # * <tt>alarm_off?</tt>
  #
  # == Scopes
  #
  # For integrations that support it, a group of default scope filters will
  # be automatically created for assisting in finding objects that have the
  # attribute set to one of a given set of states.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   Vehicle.with_state(:parked)               # => All vehicles where the state is parked
  #   Vehicle.with_states(:parked, :idling)     # => All vehicles where the state is either parked or idling
  #
  #   Vehicle.without_state(:parked)            # => All vehicles where the state is *not* parked
  #   Vehicle.without_states(:parked, :idling)  # => All vehicles where the state is *not* parked or idling
  #
  # *Note* that if class methods already exist with those names (i.e.
  # :with_state, :with_states, :without_state, or :without_states), then a
  # scope will not be defined for that name.
  #
  # See StateMachines::Machine for more information about using integrations
  # and the individual integration docs for information about the actual
  # scopes that are generated.
