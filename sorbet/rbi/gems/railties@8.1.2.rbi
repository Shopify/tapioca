# An Engine with the responsibility of coordinating the whole boot process.
#
# == Initialization
#
# Rails::Application is responsible for executing all railties and engines
# initializers. It also executes some bootstrap initializers (check
# Rails::Application::Bootstrap) and finishing initializers, after all the others
# are executed (check Rails::Application::Finisher).
#
# == \Configuration
#
# Besides providing the same configuration as Rails::Engine and Rails::Railtie,
# the application object has several specific configurations, for example
# +enable_reloading+, +consider_all_requests_local+, +filter_parameters+,
# +logger+, and so forth.
#
# Check Rails::Application::Configuration to see them all.
#
# == Routes
#
# The application object is also responsible for holding the routes and reloading routes
# whenever the files change in development.
#
# == Middlewares
#
# The Application is also responsible for building the middleware stack.
#
# == Booting process
#
# The application is also responsible for setting up and executing the booting
# process. From the moment you require <tt>config/application.rb</tt> in your app,
# the booting process goes like this:
#
# 1.  <tt>require "config/boot.rb"</tt> to set up load paths.
# 2.  +require+ railties and engines.
# 3.  Define +Rails.application+ as <tt>class MyApp::Application < Rails::Application</tt>.
# 4.  Run +config.before_configuration+ callbacks.
# 5.  Load <tt>config/environments/ENV.rb</tt>.
# 6.  Run +config.before_initialize+ callbacks.
# 7.  Run <tt>Railtie#initializer</tt> defined by railties, engines, and application.
#     One by one, each engine sets up its load paths and routes, and runs its <tt>config/initializers/*</tt> files.
# 8.  Custom <tt>Railtie#initializers</tt> added by railties, engines, and applications are executed.
# 9.  Build the middleware stack and run +to_prepare+ callbacks.
# 10. Run +config.before_eager_load+ and +eager_load!+ if +eager_load+ is +true+.
# 11. Run +config.after_initialize+ callbacks.

  # Returns a message verifier object.
  #
  # This verifier can be used to generate and verify signed messages in the application.

  #
  # For instance, +ActiveStorage::Blob.signed_id_verifier+ is implemented using this feature, which assures that
  # the IDs strings haven't been tampered with and are safe to use in a finder.
  #
  # See the ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier documentation for more information.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  #
  # * +verifier_name+ - the name of the message verifier.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #     message = Rails.application.message_verifier('my_purpose').generate('data to sign against tampering')
  #     Rails.application.message_verifier('my_purpose').verify(message)
  #     # => 'data to sign against tampering'

  # Returns a message verifier factory (ActiveSupport::MessageVerifiers). This
  # factory can be used as a central point to configure and create message
  # verifiers (ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier) for your application.
  #
  # By default, message verifiers created by this factory will generate
  # messages using the default ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier options. You can
  # override these options with a combination of
  # ActiveSupport::MessageVerifiers#clear_rotations and
  # ActiveSupport::MessageVerifiers#rotate. However, this must be done prior
  # to building any message verifier instances. For example, in a
  # +before_initialize+ block:
  #
  #   # Use `url_safe: true` when generating messages
  #   config.before_initialize do |app|
  #     app.message_verifiers.clear_rotations
  #     app.message_verifiers.rotate(url_safe: true)
  #   end
  #
  # Message verifiers created by this factory will always use a secret derived
  # from #secret_key_base when generating messages. +clear_rotations+ will not
  # affect this behavior. However, older +secret_key_base+ values can be
  # rotated for verifying messages:
  #
  #   # Fall back to old `secret_key_base` when verifying messages
  #   config.before_initialize do |app|
  #     app.message_verifiers.rotate(secret_key_base: "old secret_key_base")
  #   end

# MiddlewareStackProxy is a proxy for the \Rails middleware stack that allows
# you to configure middlewares in your application. It works basically as a
# command recorder, saving each command to be applied after initialization
# over the default middleware stack, so you can add, swap, or remove any
# middleware in \Rails.
#
# You can add your own middlewares by using the +config.middleware.use+ method:
#
#     config.middleware.use Magical::Unicorns
#
# This will put the +Magical::Unicorns+ middleware on the end of the stack.
# You can use +insert_before+ if you wish to add a middleware before another:
#
#     config.middleware.insert_before Rack::Head, Magical::Unicorns
#
# There's also +insert_after+ which will insert a middleware after another:
#
#     config.middleware.insert_after Rack::Head, Magical::Unicorns
#
# Middlewares can also be completely swapped out and replaced with others:
#
#     config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Flash, Magical::Unicorns
#
# Middlewares can be moved from one place to another:
#
#     config.middleware.move_before ActionDispatch::Flash, Magical::Unicorns
#
# This will move the +Magical::Unicorns+ middleware before the
# +ActionDispatch::Flash+. You can also move it after:
#
#     config.middleware.move_after ActionDispatch::Flash, Magical::Unicorns
#
# And finally they can also be removed from the stack completely:
#
#     config.middleware.delete ActionDispatch::Flash

# +Rails::Engine+ allows you to wrap a specific \Rails application or subset of
# functionality and share it with other applications or within a larger packaged application.
# Every Rails::Application is just an engine, which allows for simple
# feature and application sharing.
#
# Any +Rails::Engine+ is also a Rails::Railtie, so the same
# methods (like {rake_tasks}[rdoc-ref:Rails::Railtie::rake_tasks] and
# {generators}[rdoc-ref:Rails::Railtie::generators]) and configuration
# options that are available in railties can also be used in engines.
#
# == Creating an Engine
#
# If you want a gem to behave as an engine, you have to specify an +Engine+
# for it somewhere inside your plugin's +lib+ folder (similar to how we
# specify a +Railtie+):
#
#   # lib/my_engine.rb
#   module MyEngine
#     class Engine < Rails::Engine
#     end
#   end
#
# Then ensure that this file is loaded at the top of your <tt>config/application.rb</tt>
# (or in your +Gemfile+), and it will automatically load models, controllers, and helpers
# inside +app+, load routes at <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>, load locales at
# <tt>config/locales/**/*</tt>, and load tasks at <tt>lib/tasks/**/*</tt>.
#
# == Configuration
#
# Like railties, engines can access a config object which contains configuration shared by
# all railties and the application.
# Additionally, each engine can access <tt>autoload_paths</tt>, <tt>eager_load_paths</tt> and
# <tt>autoload_once_paths</tt> settings which are scoped to that engine.
#
#   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
#     # Add a load path for this specific Engine
#     config.autoload_paths << File.expand_path("lib/some/path", __dir__)
#
#     initializer "my_engine.add_middleware" do |app|
#       app.middleware.use MyEngine::Middleware
#     end
#   end
#
# == Generators
#
# You can set up generators for engines with <tt>config.generators</tt> method:
#
#   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
#     config.generators do |g|
#       g.orm             :active_record
#       g.template_engine :erb
#       g.test_framework  :test_unit
#     end
#   end
#
# You can also set generators for an application by using <tt>config.app_generators</tt>:
#
#   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
#     # note that you can also pass block to app_generators in the same way you
#     # can pass it to generators method
#     config.app_generators.orm :datamapper
#   end
#
# == Paths
#
# Applications and engines have flexible path configuration, meaning that you
# are not required to place your controllers at <tt>app/controllers</tt>, but
# in any place which you find convenient.
#
# For example, let's suppose you want to place your controllers in <tt>lib/controllers</tt>.
# You can set that as an option:
#
#   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
#     paths["app/controllers"] = "lib/controllers"
#   end
#
# You can also have your controllers loaded from both <tt>app/controllers</tt> and
# <tt>lib/controllers</tt>:
#
#   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
#     paths["app/controllers"] << "lib/controllers"
#   end
#
# The available paths in an engine are:
#
#   class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
#     paths["app"]                 # => ["app"]
#     paths["app/controllers"]     # => ["app/controllers"]
#     paths["app/helpers"]         # => ["app/helpers"]
#     paths["app/models"]          # => ["app/models"]
#     paths["app/views"]           # => ["app/views"]
#     paths["lib"]                 # => ["lib"]
#     paths["lib/tasks"]           # => ["lib/tasks"]
#     paths["config"]              # => ["config"]
#     paths["config/initializers"] # => ["config/initializers"]
#     paths["config/locales"]      # => ["config/locales"]
#     paths["config/routes.rb"]    # => ["config/routes.rb"]
#   end
#
# The <tt>Application</tt> class adds a couple more paths to this set. And as in your
# <tt>Application</tt>, all folders under +app+ are automatically added to the load path.
# If you have an <tt>app/services</tt> folder for example, it will be added by default.
#
# == Endpoint
#
# An engine can also be a Rack application. It can be useful if you have a Rack application that
# you would like to provide with some of the +Engine+'s features.
#
# To do that, use the ::endpoint method:
#
#   module MyEngine
#     class Engine < Rails::Engine
#       endpoint MyRackApplication
#     end
#   end
#
# Now you can mount your engine in application's routes:
#
#   Rails.application.routes.draw do
#     mount MyEngine::Engine => "/engine"
#   end
#
# == Middleware stack
#
# As an engine can now be a Rack endpoint, it can also have a middleware
# stack. The usage is exactly the same as in <tt>Application</tt>:
#
#   module MyEngine
#     class Engine < Rails::Engine
#       middleware.use SomeMiddleware
#     end
#   end
#
# == Routes
#
# If you don't specify an endpoint, routes will be used as the default
# endpoint. You can use them just like you use an application's routes:
#
#   # ENGINE/config/routes.rb
#   MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
#     get "/" => "posts#index"
#   end
#
# == Mount priority
#
# Note that now there can be more than one router in your application, and it's better to avoid
# passing requests through many routers. Consider this situation:
#
#   Rails.application.routes.draw do
#     mount MyEngine::Engine => "/blog"
#     get "/blog/omg" => "main#omg"
#   end
#
# +MyEngine+ is mounted at <tt>/blog</tt>, and <tt>/blog/omg</tt> points to application's
# controller. In such a situation, requests to <tt>/blog/omg</tt> will go through +MyEngine+,
# and if there is no such route in +Engine+'s routes, it will be dispatched to <tt>main#omg</tt>.
# It's much better to swap that:
#
#   Rails.application.routes.draw do
#     get "/blog/omg" => "main#omg"
#     mount MyEngine::Engine => "/blog"
#   end
#
# Now, +Engine+ will get only requests that were not handled by +Application+.
#
# == Engine name
#
# There are some places where an Engine's name is used:
#
# * routes: when you mount an Engine with <tt>mount(MyEngine::Engine => '/my_engine')</tt>,
#   it's used as default <tt>:as</tt> option
# * rake task for installing migrations <tt>my_engine:install:migrations</tt>
#
# Engine name is set by default based on class name. For +MyEngine::Engine+ it will be
# <tt>my_engine_engine</tt>. You can change it manually using the <tt>engine_name</tt> method:
#
#   module MyEngine
#     class Engine < Rails::Engine
#       engine_name "my_engine"
#     end
#   end
#
# == Isolated Engine
#
# Normally when you create controllers, helpers, and models inside an engine, they are treated
# as if they were created inside the application itself. This means that all helpers and
# named routes from the application will be available to your engine's controllers as well.
#
# However, sometimes you want to isolate your engine from the application, especially if your engine
# has its own router. To do that, you simply need to call ::isolate_namespace. This method requires
# you to pass a module where all your controllers, helpers, and models should be nested to:
#
#   module MyEngine
#     class Engine < Rails::Engine
#       isolate_namespace MyEngine
#     end
#   end
#
# With such an engine, everything that is inside the +MyEngine+ module will be isolated from
# the application.
#
# Consider this controller:
#
#   module MyEngine
#     class FooController < ActionController::Base
#     end
#   end
#
# If the +MyEngine+ engine is marked as isolated, +FooController+ only has
# access to helpers from +MyEngine+, and <tt>url_helpers</tt> from
# <tt>MyEngine::Engine.routes</tt>.
#
# The next thing that changes in isolated engines is the behavior of routes.
# Normally, when you namespace your controllers, you also need to namespace
# the related routes. With an isolated engine, the engine's namespace is
# automatically applied, so you don't need to specify it explicitly in your
# routes:
#
#   MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
#     resources :articles
#   end
#
# If +MyEngine+ is isolated, the routes above will point to
# +MyEngine::ArticlesController+. You also don't need to use longer
# URL helpers like +my_engine_articles_path+. Instead, you should simply use
# +articles_path+, like you would do with your main application.
#
# To make this behavior consistent with other parts of the framework,
# isolated engines also have an effect on ActiveModel::Naming. In a
# normal \Rails app, when you use a namespaced model such as
# +Namespace::Article+, ActiveModel::Naming will generate
# names with the prefix "namespace". In an isolated engine, the prefix will
# be omitted in URL helpers and form fields, for convenience.
#
#   polymorphic_url(MyEngine::Article.new)
#   # => "articles_path" # not "my_engine_articles_path"
#
#   form_with(model: MyEngine::Article.new) do
#     text_field :title # => <input type="text" name="article[title]" id="article_title" />
#   end
#
# Additionally, an isolated engine will set its own name according to its
# namespace, so <tt>MyEngine::Engine.engine_name</tt> will return
# "my_engine". It will also set +MyEngine.table_name_prefix+ to "my_engine_",
# meaning for example that +MyEngine::Article+ will use the
# +my_engine_articles+ database table by default.
#
# == Using Engine's routes outside Engine
#
# Since you can now mount an engine inside application's routes, you do not have direct access to +Engine+'s
# <tt>url_helpers</tt> inside +Application+. When you mount an engine in an application's routes, a special helper is
# created to allow you to do that. Consider such a scenario:
#
#   # config/routes.rb
#   Rails.application.routes.draw do
#     mount MyEngine::Engine => "/my_engine", as: "my_engine"
#     get "/foo" => "foo#index"
#   end
#
# Now, you can use the <tt>my_engine</tt> helper inside your application:
#
#   class FooController < ApplicationController
#     def index
#       my_engine.root_url # => /my_engine/
#     end
#   end
#
# There is also a <tt>main_app</tt> helper that gives you access to application's routes inside Engine:
#
#   module MyEngine
#     class BarController
#       def index
#         main_app.foo_path # => /foo
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
# Note that the <tt>:as</tt> option given to mount takes the <tt>engine_name</tt> as default, so most of the time
# you can simply omit it.
#
# Finally, if you want to generate a URL to an engine's route using
# <tt>polymorphic_url</tt>, you also need to pass the engine helper. Let's
# say that you want to create a form pointing to one of the engine's routes.
# All you need to do is pass the helper as the first element in array with
# attributes for URL:
#
#   form_with(model: [my_engine, @user])
#
# This code will use <tt>my_engine.user_path(@user)</tt> to generate the proper route.
#
# == Isolated engine's helpers
#
# Sometimes you may want to isolate an engine, but use helpers that are defined for it.
# If you want to share just a few specific helpers you can add them to application's
# helpers in ApplicationController:
#
#   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
#     helper MyEngine::SharedEngineHelper
#   end
#
# If you want to include all of the engine's helpers, you can use the #helper method on an engine's
# instance:
#
#   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
#     helper MyEngine::Engine.helpers
#   end
#
# It will include all of the helpers from engine's directory. Take into account this does
# not include helpers defined in controllers with helper_method or other similar solutions,
# only helpers defined in the helpers directory will be included.
#
# == Migrations & seed data
#
# Engines can have their own migrations. The default path for migrations is exactly the same
# as in application: <tt>db/migrate</tt>
#
# To use engine's migrations in application you can use the rake task below, which copies them to
# application's dir:
#
#   $ rake ENGINE_NAME:install:migrations
#
# Note that some of the migrations may be skipped if a migration with the same name already exists
# in application. In such a situation you must decide whether to leave that migration or rename the
# migration in the application and rerun copying migrations.
#
# If your engine has migrations, you may also want to prepare data for the database in
# the <tt>db/seeds.rb</tt> file. You can load that data using the <tt>load_seed</tt> method, e.g.
#
#   MyEngine::Engine.load_seed
#
# == Loading priority
#
# In order to change engine's priority you can use +config.railties_order+ in the main application.
# It will affect the priority of loading views, helpers, assets, and all the other files
# related to engine or application.
#
#   # load Blog::Engine with highest priority, followed by application and other railties
#   config.railties_order = [Blog::Engine, :main_app, :all]

# ActiveModel is a class to be implemented by each ORM to allow \Rails to
# generate customized controller code.
#
# The API has the same methods as ActiveRecord, but each method returns a
# string that matches the ORM API.
#
# For example:
#
#   ActiveRecord::Generators::ActiveModel.find(Foo, "params[:id]")
#   # => "Foo.find(params[:id])"
#
#   DataMapper::Generators::ActiveModel.find(Foo, "params[:id]")
#   # => "Foo.get(params[:id])"
#
# On initialization, the ActiveModel accepts the instance name that will
# receive the calls:
#
#   builder = ActiveRecord::Generators::ActiveModel.new "@foo"
#   builder.save # => "@foo.save"
#
# The only exception in ActiveModel for ActiveRecord is the use of self.build
# instead of self.new.

  # ==== Options
  #
  # [+:meta_options+]
  #   A list of generator options which only serve to trigger other options.
  #   These options should have no other effects, and will be treated
  #   transparently when revoking other options.
  #
  #   For example: --minimal implies both --skip-active-job and
  #   --skip-active-storage. Also, --skip-active-job by itself implies
  #   --skip-active-storage. If --skip-active-job is explicitly
  #   specified, --no-skip-active-storage should raise an error. But, if
  #   only --minimal is specified, --no-skip-active-storage should "undo"
  #   the implied --skip-active-job. This can be accomplished by passing
  #   <tt>meta_options: [:minimal]</tt>.
  #
  #   In contrast, --api is not a meta option because it does other things
  #   besides implying options such as --skip-asset-pipeline. (And so --api
  #   with --no-skip-asset-pipeline should raise an error.)

    #
    #   module Rails::Generators
    #     class ControllerGenerator < Base
    #       hook_for :test_framework, aliases: "-t"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # The example above will create a test framework option and will invoke
    # a generator based on the user supplied value.
    #
    # For example, if the user invoke the controller generator as:
    #
    #   $ bin/rails generate controller Account --test-framework=test_unit
    #
    # The controller generator will then try to invoke the following generators:
    #
    #   "rails:test_unit", "test_unit:controller", "test_unit"
    #
    # Notice that "rails:generators:test_unit" could be loaded as well, what
    # \Rails looks for is the first and last parts of the namespace. This is what
    # allows any test framework to hook into \Rails as long as it provides any
    # of the hooks above.
    #
    # ==== Options
    #
    # The first and last part used to find the generator to be invoked are
    # guessed based on class invokes hook_for, as noticed in the example above.
    # This can be customized with two options: +:in+ and +:as+.
    #
    # Let's suppose you are creating a generator that needs to invoke the
    # controller generator from test unit. Your first attempt is:
    #
    #   class AwesomeGenerator < Rails::Generators::Base
    #     hook_for :test_framework
    #   end
    #
    # The lookup in this case for test_unit as input is:
    #
    #   "test_unit:awesome", "test_unit"
    #
    # Which is not the desired lookup. You can change it by providing the
    # +:as+ option:
    #
    #   class AwesomeGenerator < Rails::Generators::Base
    #     hook_for :test_framework, as: :controller
    #   end
    #
    # And now it will look up at:
    #
    #   "test_unit:controller", "test_unit"
    #
    # Similarly, if you want it to also look up in the rails namespace, you
    # just need to provide the +:in+ value:
    #
    #   class AwesomeGenerator < Rails::Generators::Base
    #     hook_for :test_framework, in: :rails, as: :controller
    #   end
    #
    # And the lookup is exactly the same as previously:
    #
    #   "rails:test_unit", "test_unit:controller", "test_unit"
    #
    # ==== Switches
    #
    # All hooks come with switches for user interface. If you do not want
    # to use any test framework, you can do:
    #
    #   $ bin/rails generate controller Account --skip-test-framework
    #
    # Or similarly:
    #
    #   $ bin/rails generate controller Account --no-test-framework
    #
    # ==== Boolean hooks
    #
    # In some cases, you may want to provide a boolean hook. For example, webrat
    # developers might want to have webrat available on controller generator.
    # This can be achieved as:
    #
    #   Rails::Generators::ControllerGenerator.hook_for :webrat, type: :boolean
    #
    # Then, if you want webrat to be invoked, just supply:
    #
    #   $ bin/rails generate controller Account --webrat
    #
    # The hooks lookup is similar as above:
    #
    #   "rails:generators:webrat", "webrat:generators:controller", "webrat"
    #
    # ==== Custom invocations
    #
    # You can also supply a block to hook_for to customize how the hook is
    # going to be invoked. The block receives two arguments, an instance
    # of the current class and the class to be invoked.
    #
    # For example, in the resource generator, the controller should be invoked
    # with a pluralized class name. But by default it is invoked with the same
    # name as the resource generator, which is singular. To change this, we
    # can give a block to customize how the controller can be invoked.
    #
    #   hook_for :resource_controller do |instance, controller|
    #     instance.invoke controller, [ instance.name.pluralize ]
    #   end
    #
    # pkg:gem/railties#lib/rails/generators/base.rb:174
    def hook_for(*names, &block); end

# Built-in Health Check Endpoint
#
# \Rails also comes with a built-in health check endpoint that is reachable at
# the +/up+ path. This endpoint will return a 200 status code if the app has
# booted with no exceptions, and a 500 status code otherwise.
#
# In production, many applications are required to report their status upstream,
# whether it's to an uptime monitor that will page an engineer when things go
# wrong, or a load balancer or Kubernetes controller used to determine a pod's
# health. This health check is designed to be a one-size fits all that will work
# in many situations.
#
# While any newly generated \Rails applications will have the health check at
# +/up+, you can configure the path to be anything you'd like in your
# <tt>"config/routes.rb"</tt>:
#
#   Rails.application.routes.draw do
#     get "healthz" => "rails/health#show", as: :rails_health_check
#   end
#
# The health check will now be accessible via the +/healthz+ path.
#
# NOTE: This endpoint does not reflect the status of all of your application's
# dependencies, such as the database or Redis cluster. Replace
# <tt>"rails/health#show"</tt> with your own controller action if you have
# application specific needs.
#
# Think carefully about what you want to check as it can lead to situations
# where your application is being restarted due to a third-party service going
# bad. Ideally, you should design your application to handle those outages
# gracefully.

# This object is an extended hash that behaves as root of the Rails::Paths system.
# It allows you to collect information about how you want to structure your application
# paths through a Hash-like \API. It requires you to give a physical path on initialization.
#
#   root = Root.new "/rails"
#   root.add "app/controllers", eager_load: true
#
# The above command creates a new root object and adds "app/controllers" as a path.
# This means we can get a Rails::Paths::Path object back like below:
#
#   path = root["app/controllers"]
#   path.eager_load?               # => true
#   path.is_a?(Rails::Paths::Path) # => true
#
# The Path[rdoc-ref:Rails::Paths::Path] object is simply an enumerable and
# allows you to easily add extra paths:
#
#   path.is_a?(Enumerable) # => true
#   path.to_ary.inspect    # => ["app/controllers"]
#
#   path << "lib/controllers"
#   path.to_ary.inspect    # => ["app/controllers", "lib/controllers"]
#
# Notice that when you add a path using #add, the
# Path[rdoc-ref:Rails::Paths::Path] object created already contains the path
# with the same path value given to #add. In some situations, you may not
# want this behavior, so you can give <tt>:with</tt> as option.
#
#   root.add "config/routes", with: "config/routes.rb"
#   root["config/routes"].inspect # => ["config/routes.rb"]
#
# The #add method accepts the following options as arguments:
# +eager_load+, +autoload+, +autoload_once+, and +glob+.
#
# Finally, the Path[rdoc-ref:Rails::Paths::Path] object also provides a few
# helpers:
#
#   root = Root.new "/rails"
#   root.add "app/controllers"
#
#   root["app/controllers"].expanded # => ["/rails/app/controllers"]
#   root["app/controllers"].existent # => ["/rails/app/controllers"]

# +Rails::Railtie+ is the core of the \Rails framework and provides
# several hooks to extend \Rails and/or modify the initialization process.
#
# Every major component of \Rails (Action Mailer, Action Controller, Active
# Record, etc.) implements a railtie. Each of them is responsible for their
# own initialization. This makes \Rails itself absent of any component hooks,
# allowing other components to be used in place of any of the \Rails defaults.
#
# Developing a \Rails extension does _not_ require implementing a railtie, but
# if you need to interact with the \Rails framework during or after boot, then
# a railtie is needed.
#
# For example, an extension doing any of the following would need a railtie:
#
# * creating initializers
# * configuring a \Rails framework for the application, like setting a generator
# * adding <tt>config.*</tt> keys to the environment
# * setting up a subscriber with ActiveSupport::Notifications
# * adding Rake tasks
#
# == Creating a Railtie
#
# To extend \Rails using a railtie, create a subclass of +Rails::Railtie+.
# This class must be loaded during the \Rails boot process, and is conventionally
# called +MyNamespace::Railtie+.
#
# The following example demonstrates an extension which can be used with or
# without \Rails.
#
#   # lib/my_gem/railtie.rb
#   module MyGem
#     class Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     end
#   end
#
#   # lib/my_gem.rb
#   require "my_gem/railtie" if defined?(Rails::Railtie)
#
# == Initializers
#
# To add an initialization step to the \Rails boot process from your railtie, just
# define the initialization code with the +initializer+ macro:
#
#   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     initializer "my_gem.configure_rails_initialization" do
#       # some initialization behavior
#     end
#   end
#
# If specified, the block can also receive the application object, in case you
# need to access some application-specific configuration, like middleware:
#
#   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     initializer "my_gem.configure_rails_initialization" do |app|
#       app.middleware.use MyGem::Middleware
#     end
#   end
#
# Finally, you can also pass <tt>:before</tt> and <tt>:after</tt> as options to
# +initializer+, in case you want to couple it with a specific step in the
# initialization process.
#
# == Configuration
#
# Railties can access a config object which contains configuration shared by all
# railties and the application:
#
#   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     # Customize the ORM
#     config.app_generators.orm :my_gem_orm
#
#     # Add a to_prepare block which is executed once in production
#     # and before each request in development.
#     config.to_prepare do
#       MyGem.setup!
#     end
#   end
#
# == Loading Rake Tasks and Generators
#
# If your railtie has Rake tasks, you can tell \Rails to load them through the method
# +rake_tasks+:
#
#   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     rake_tasks do
#       load "path/to/my_gem.tasks"
#     end
#   end
#
# By default, \Rails loads generators from your load path. However, if you want to place
# your generators at a different location, you can specify in your railtie a block which
# will load them during normal generators lookup:
#
#   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     generators do
#       require "path/to/my_gem_generator"
#     end
#   end
#
# Since filenames on the load path are shared across gems, be sure that files you load
# through a railtie have unique names.
#
# == Run another program when the \Rails server starts
#
# In development, it's very usual to have to run another process next to the \Rails Server. In example
# you might want to start the Webpack or React server. Or maybe you need to run your job scheduler process
# like Sidekiq. This is usually done by opening a new shell and running the program from here.
#
# \Rails allow you to specify a +server+ block which will get called when a \Rails server starts.
# This way, your users don't need to remember to have to open a new shell and run another program, making
# this less confusing for everyone.
# It can be used like this:
#
#   class MyGem::Railtie < Rails::Railtie
#     server do
#       WebpackServer.start
#     end
#   end
#
# == Application and Engine
#
# An engine is nothing more than a railtie with some initializers already set. And since
# Rails::Application is an engine, the same configuration described here can be
# used in both.
#
# Be sure to look at the documentation of those specific classes for more information.
