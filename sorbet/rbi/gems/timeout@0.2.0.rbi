module Timeout

  # Perform an operation in a block, raising an error if it takes longer than
  # +sec+ seconds to complete.
  #
  # +sec+:: Number of seconds to wait for the block to terminate. Any number
  #         may be used, including Floats to specify fractional seconds. A
  #         value of 0 or +nil+ will execute the block without any timeout.
  # +klass+:: Exception Class to raise if the block fails to terminate
  #           in +sec+ seconds.  Omitting will use the default, Timeout::Error
  # +message+:: Error message to raise with Exception Class.
  #             Omitting will use the default, "execution expired"
  #
  # Returns the result of the block *if* the block completed before
  # +sec+ seconds, otherwise throws an exception, based on the value of +klass+.
  #
  # The exception thrown to terminate the given block cannot be rescued inside
  # the block unless +klass+ is given explicitly. However, the block can use
  # ensure to prevent the handling of the exception.  For that reason, this
  # method cannot be relied on to enforce timeouts for untrusted blocks.
  #
  # If a scheduler is defined, it will be used to handle the timeout by invoking
  # Scheduler#timeout_after.
  #
  # Note that this is both a method of module Timeout, so you can <tt>include
  # Timeout</tt> into your classes so they have a #timeout method, as well as
  # a module method, so you can call it directly as Timeout.timeout().
