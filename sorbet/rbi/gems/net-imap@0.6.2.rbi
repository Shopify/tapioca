# Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (\IMAP) client
# functionality.  The protocol is described
# in {IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501]
# and {IMAP4rev2 [RFC9051]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051].
#
# == \IMAP Overview
#
# An \IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates
# itself using either #authenticate or #login.  Having
# authenticated itself, there is a range of commands
# available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be
# arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which
# contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on
# the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it
# will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format
# within a hierarchy of directories.
#
# To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must
# first select that mailbox, using either #select or #examine
# (for read-only access).  Once the client has successfully
# selected a mailbox, they enter the +selected+ state, and that
# mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item
# related commands implicitly operate.
#
# === Connection state
#
# Once an IMAP connection is established, the connection is in one of four
# states: <tt>not authenticated</tt>, +authenticated+, +selected+, and
# +logout+.  Most commands are valid only in certain states.
#
# See #connection_state.
#
# === Sequence numbers and UIDs
#
# Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence
# numbers and UIDs.
#
# Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox
# from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new
# message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence
# number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages
# are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their
# sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.
#
# To avoid sequence number race conditions, servers must not expunge messages
# when no command is in progress, nor when responding to #fetch, #store, or
# #search.  Expunges _may_ be sent during any other command, including
# #uid_fetch, #uid_store, and #uid_search.  The #noop and #idle commands are
# both useful for this side-effect: they allow the server to send all mailbox
# updates, including expunges.
#
# UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to
# identify another message within the same mailbox, even if
# the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to
# be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential)
# order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client
# rearranges the order of mail items within a mailbox, the
# UIDs have to be reassigned.  An \IMAP client thus cannot
# rearrange message orders.
#
# === Examples of Usage
#
# ==== List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
#   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
#   imap.examine('INBOX')
#   imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
#     envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
#     puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
#   end
#
# ==== Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
#   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
#   imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
#   if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
#     imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
#   end
#   imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
#     imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
#     imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
#   end
#   imap.expunge
#
# == Capabilities
#
# Most Net::IMAP methods do not _currently_ modify their behaviour according
# to the server's advertised #capabilities.  Users of this class must check
# that the server is capable of extension commands or command arguments before
# sending them.  Special care should be taken to follow the #capabilities
# requirements for #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
#
# See #capable?, #auth_capable?, #capabilities, #auth_mechanisms to discover
# server capabilities.  For relevant capability requirements, see the
# documentation on each \IMAP command.
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new("mail.example.com")
#   imap.capable?(:IMAP4rev1) or raise "Not an IMAP4rev1 server"
#   imap.capable?(:starttls)  or raise "Cannot start TLS"
#   imap.starttls
#
#   if imap.auth_capable?("PLAIN")
#     imap.authenticate "PLAIN", username, password
#   elsif !imap.capability?("LOGINDISABLED")
#     imap.login username, password
#   else
#     raise "No acceptable authentication mechanisms"
#   end
#
#   # Support for "UTF8=ACCEPT" implies support for "ENABLE"
#   imap.enable :utf8 if imap.capable?("UTF8=ACCEPT")
#
#   namespaces  = imap.namespace if imap.capable?(:namespace)
#   mbox_prefix = namespaces&.personal&.first&.prefix || ""
#   mbox_delim  = namespaces&.personal&.first&.delim  || "/"
#   mbox_path   = prefix + %w[path to my mailbox].join(delim)
#   imap.create mbox_path
#
# === Basic IMAP4rev1 capabilities
#
# IMAP4rev1 servers must advertise +IMAP4rev1+ in their capabilities list.
# IMAP4rev1 servers must _implement_ the +STARTTLS+, <tt>AUTH=PLAIN</tt>,
# and +LOGINDISABLED+ capabilities.  See #starttls, #login, and #authenticate
# for the implications of these capabilities.
#
# === Caching +CAPABILITY+ responses
#
# Net::IMAP automatically stores and discards capability data according to the
# the requirements and recommendations in
# {IMAP4rev2 §6.1.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.1.1],
# {§6.2}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.2], and
# {§7.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-7.1].
# Use #capable?, #auth_capable?, or #capabilities to use this cache and avoid
# sending the #capability command unnecessarily.
#
# The server may advertise its initial capabilities using the +CAPABILITY+
# ResponseCode in a +PREAUTH+ or +OK+ #greeting.  When TLS has started
# (#starttls) and after authentication (#login or #authenticate), the server's
# capabilities may change and cached capabilities are discarded.  The server
# may send updated capabilities with an +OK+ TaggedResponse to #login or
# #authenticate, and these will be cached by Net::IMAP.  But the
# TaggedResponse to #starttls MUST be ignored--it is sent before TLS starts
# and is unprotected.
#
# When storing capability values to variables, be careful that they are
# discarded or reset appropriately, especially following #starttls.
#
# === Using IMAP4rev1 extensions
#
# See the {IANA IMAP4 capabilities
# registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities] for a list of
# all standard capabilities, and their reference RFCs.
#
# IMAP4rev1 servers must not activate behavior that is incompatible with the
# base specification until an explicit client action invokes a capability,
# e.g. sending a command or command argument specific to that capability.
# Servers may send data with backward compatible behavior, such as response
# codes or mailbox attributes, at any time without client action.
#
# Invoking capabilities which are unknown to Net::IMAP may cause unexpected
# behavior and errors.  For example, ResponseParseError is raised when
# unknown response syntax is received.  Invoking commands or command
# parameters that are unsupported by the server may raise NoResponseError,
# BadResponseError, or cause other unexpected behavior.
#
# Some capabilities must be explicitly activated using the #enable command.
# See #enable for details.
#
# == Thread Safety
#
# Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
#   imap.authenticate("scram-md5", "bar", "password")
#   imap.select("inbox")
#   fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
#   search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
#   fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
#   imap.disconnect
#
# This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
#
# When running multiple commands, care must be taken to avoid ambiguity.  For
# example, SEARCH responses are ambiguous about which command they are
# responding to, so search commands should not run simultaneously, unless the
# server supports +ESEARCH+ {[RFC4731]}[https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4731] or
# IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051].  See {RFC9051
# §5.5}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html#section-5.5] for
# other examples of command sequences which should not be pipelined.
#
# == Unbounded memory use
#
# Net::IMAP reads server responses in a separate receiver thread per client.
# Unhandled response data is saved to #responses, and response_handlers run
# inside the receiver thread.  See the list of methods for {handling server
# responses}[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP@Handling+server+responses], below.
#
# Because the receiver thread continuously reads and saves new responses, some
# scenarios must be careful to avoid unbounded memory use:
#
# * Commands such as #list or #fetch can have an enormous number of responses.
# * Commands such as #fetch can result in an enormous size per response.
# * Long-lived connections will gradually accumulate unsolicited server
#   responses, especially +EXISTS+, +FETCH+, and +EXPUNGE+ responses.
# * A buggy or untrusted server could send inappropriate responses, which
#   could be very numerous, very large, and very rapid.
#
# Use paginated or limited versions of commands whenever possible.
#
# Use Config#max_response_size to impose a limit on incoming server responses
# as they are being read.  <em>This is especially important for untrusted
# servers.</em>
#
# Use #add_response_handler to handle responses after each one is received.
# Use the +response_handlers+ argument to ::new to assign response handlers
# before the receiver thread is started.  Use #extract_responses,
# #clear_responses, or #responses (with a block) to prune responses.
#
# == Errors
#
# An \IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate
# failure:
#
# NO:: the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For
#      instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect;
#      the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.
#
# BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's
#       understanding of the \IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting
#       commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting
#       to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current
#       mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server
#       failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.
#
# BYE:: the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal
#       logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence
#       to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling
#       to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command,
#       it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that
#       the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
#
# These three error response are represented by the errors
# Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and
# Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of
# Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve
# sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors.
# Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.
#
# Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods
# are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when
# working with sockets.  These are generally represented as
# Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a
# request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could
# raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly
# goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2),
# and associated man pages.
#
# Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data
# is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting
# between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is
# thrown if a server response is non-parseable.

#
# ==== Selected state
#
# In addition to the commands for any state and the +authenticated+
# commands, the following commands are valid in the +selected+ state:
#
# - #close: Closes the mailbox and returns to the +authenticated+ state,
#   expunging deleted messages, unless the mailbox was opened as read-only.

#   Can be replaced with #noop or #idle.
#
# ==== Logout state
#
# No \IMAP commands are valid in the +logout+ state.  If the socket is still
# open, Net::IMAP will close it after receiving server confirmation.
# Exceptions will be raised by \IMAP commands that have already started and
# are waiting for a response, as well as any that are called after logout.

class Net::IMAP < ::Net::Protocol
  include ::Net::IMAP::DeprecatedClientOptions
  include ::MonitorMixin
  extend ::Net::IMAP::Authenticators

  # Creates a new Net::IMAP object and connects it to the specified
  # +host+.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # Accepts the following options:
  #
  # [port]
  #   Port number.  Defaults to 993 when +ssl+ is truthy, and 143 otherwise.
  #
  # [ssl]
  #   If +true+, the connection will use TLS with the default params set by
  #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params].
  #   If +ssl+ is a hash, it's passed to
  #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params];
  #   the keys are names of attribute assignment methods on
  #   SSLContext[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html].  For example:
  #
  #   [{ca_file}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-ca_file]]
  #     The path to a file containing a PEM-format CA certificate.
  #   [{ca_path}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-ca_path]]
  #     The path to a directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
  #   [{min_version}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-min_version-3D]]
  #     Sets the lower bound on the supported SSL/TLS protocol version. Set to
  #     an +OpenSSL+ constant such as +OpenSSL::SSL::TLS1_2_VERSION+,
  #   [{verify_mode}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-verify_mode]]
  #     SSL session verification mode.  Valid modes include
  #     +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER+ and +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE+.
  #
  #   See {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html] for other valid SSL context params.
  #
  #   See DeprecatedClientOptions.new for deprecated SSL arguments.
  #
  # [response_handlers]
  #   A list of response handlers to be added before the receiver thread is
  #   started.  This ensures every server response is handled, including the
  #   #greeting.  Note that the greeting is handled in the current thread, but
  #   all other responses are handled in the receiver thread.
  #
  # [config]
  #   A Net::IMAP::Config object to use as the basis for #config.  By default,
  #   the global Net::IMAP.config is used.
  #
  #   >>>
  #     *NOTE:* +config+ does not set #config directly---it sets the _parent_
  #     config for inheritance.  Every client creates its own unique #config.
  #
  #   All other keyword arguments are forwarded to Net::IMAP::Config.new, to
  #   initialize the client's #config. For example:
  #
  #   [{open_timeout}[rdoc-ref:Config#open_timeout]]
  #     Seconds to wait until a connection is opened
  #   [{idle_response_timeout}[rdoc-ref:Config#idle_response_timeout]]
  #     Seconds to wait until an IDLE response is received
  #
  #   See Net::IMAP::Config for other valid options.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  # Connect to cleartext port 143 at mail.example.com and receive the server greeting:
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: false) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>
  #   imap.port          => 143
  #   imap.tls_verified? => false
  #   imap.greeting      => name: ("OK" | "PREAUTH") => status
  #   status # => "OK"
  #   # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
  #
  # Connect with TLS to port 993
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: true) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>
  #   imap.port          => 993
  #   imap.tls_verified? => true
  #   imap.greeting      => name: (/OK/i | /PREAUTH/i) => status
  #   case status
  #   in /OK/i
  #     # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
  #     imap.authenticate("PLAIN", "joe_user", "joes_password")
  #   in /PREAUTH/i
  #     # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
  #   end
  #
  # Connect with prior authentication, for example using an SSL certificate:
  #   ssl_ctx_params = {
  #     cert: OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("client.crt")),
  #     key:  OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(File.read('client.key')),
  #     extra_chain_cert: [
  #       OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("intermediate.crt")),
  #     ],
  #   }
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: ssl_ctx_params)
  #   imap.port          => 993
  #   imap.tls_verified? => true
  #   imap.greeting      => name: "PREAUTH"
  #   # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
  #
  # ==== Exceptions
  #
  # The most common errors are:
  #
  # [Errno::ECONNREFUSED]
  #   Connection refused by +host+ or an intervening firewall.
  # [Errno::ETIMEDOUT]
  #   Connection timed out (possibly due to packets being dropped by an
  #   intervening firewall).
  # [Errno::ENETUNREACH]
  #   There is no route to that network.
  # [SocketError]
  #   Hostname not known or other socket error.
  # [Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError]
  #   Connected to the host successfully, but it immediately said goodbye.
  #
  # pkg:gem/net-imap#lib/net/imap.rb:1078
  def initialize(host, port_or_options = T.unsafe(nil), *deprecated, **options); end

  # Adds a response handler. For example, to detect when
  # the server sends a new EXISTS response (which normally
  # indicates new messages being added to the mailbox),
  # add the following handler after selecting the
  # mailbox:
  #
  #   imap.add_response_handler { |resp|
  #     if resp.kind_of?(Net::IMAP::UntaggedResponse) and resp.name == "EXISTS"
  #       puts "Mailbox now has #{resp.data} messages"
  #     end
  #   }
  #
  # Response handlers can also be added when the client is created before the
  # receiver thread is started, by the +response_handlers+ argument to ::new.
  # This ensures every server response is handled, including the #greeting.
  #
  # Related: #remove_response_handler, #response_handlers
  #
  # pkg:gem/net-imap#lib/net/imap.rb:3325
  def add_response_handler(handler = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Sends an {APPEND command [IMAP4rev1 §6.3.11]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501#section-6.3.11]
  # to append the +message+ to the end of the +mailbox+. The optional +flags+
  # argument is an array of flags initially passed to the new message.  The
  # optional +date_time+ argument specifies the creation time to assign to the
  # new message; it defaults to the current time.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   imap.append("inbox", <<EOF.gsub(/\n/, "\r\n"), [:Seen], Time.now)
  #   Subject: hello
  #   From: shugo@ruby-lang.org
  #   To: shugo@ruby-lang.org
  #
  #   hello world
  #   EOF
  #
  # A Net::IMAP::NoResponseError is raised if the mailbox does
  # not exist (it is not created automatically), or if the flags,
  # date_time, or message arguments contain errors.
  #
  # ==== Capabilities
  #
  # If +UIDPLUS+ [RFC4315[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4315.html]] is
  # supported and the destination supports persistent UIDs, the server's
  # response should include an +APPENDUID+ response code with AppendUIDData.
  # This will report the UIDVALIDITY of the destination mailbox and the
  # assigned UID of the appended message.

  #
  # ==== Mechanisms
  #
  # Each mechanism has different properties and requirements.  Please consult
  # the documentation for the specific mechanisms you are using:
  #
  # +ANONYMOUS+::
  #     See AnonymousAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::AnonymousAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Allows the user to gain access to public services or resources without
  #     authenticating or disclosing an identity.
  #
  # +EXTERNAL+::
  #     See ExternalAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ExternalAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Authenticates using already established credentials, such as a TLS
  #     certificate or IPsec.
  #
  # +OAUTHBEARER+::
  #     See OAuthBearerAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::OAuthBearerAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Login using an OAuth2 Bearer token.  This is the standard mechanism
  #     for using OAuth2 with \SASL, but it is not yet deployed as widely as
  #     +XOAUTH2+.
  #
  # +PLAIN+::
  #     See PlainAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::PlainAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Login using clear-text username and password.
  #
  # +SCRAM-SHA-1+::
  # +SCRAM-SHA-256+::
  #     See ScramAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ScramAuthenticator].
  #
  #     Login by username and password.  The password is not sent to the
  #     server but is used in a salted challenge/response exchange.
  #     +SCRAM-SHA-1+ and +SCRAM-SHA-256+ are directly supported by
  #     Net::IMAP::SASL.  New authenticators can easily be added for any other
  #     <tt>SCRAM-*</tt> mechanism if the digest algorithm is supported by
  #     OpenSSL::Digest.
  #
  # +XOAUTH2+::
  #     See XOAuth2Authenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::XOAuth2Authenticator].
  #
  #     Login using a username and an OAuth2 access token.  Non-standard and
  #     obsoleted by +OAUTHBEARER+, but widely supported.
  #
  # See the {SASL mechanism
  # registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml]
  # for a list of all SASL mechanisms and their specifications.  To register
  # new authenticators, see Authenticators.
  #
  # ===== Deprecated mechanisms
  #
  # <em>Obsolete mechanisms should be avoided, but are still available for
  # backwards compatibility.  See</em> Net::IMAP::SASL@Deprecated+mechanisms.
  # <em>Using a deprecated mechanism will print a warning.</em>
  #
  # ==== Capabilities
  #
  # <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capabilities indicate server support for
  # mechanisms.  Use #auth_capable? or #auth_mechanisms to check for support
  # before using a particular mechanism.
  #
  #    if imap.auth_capable? "XOAUTH2"
  #      imap.authenticate "XOAUTH2", username, oauth2_access_token
  #    elsif imap.auth_capable? "PLAIN"
  #      imap.authenticate "PLAIN", username, password
  #    elsif !imap.capability? "LOGINDISABLED"
  #      imap.login username, password
  #    else
  #      raise "No acceptable authentication mechanism is available"
  #    end
  #
  # Although servers should list all supported \SASL mechanisms, they may
  # allow authentication with an unlisted +mechanism+.
  #
  # If [SASL-IR[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4959.html]] is supported
  # and the appropriate <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capability is present,
  # an "initial response" may be sent as an argument to the +AUTHENTICATE+
  # command, saving a round-trip.  The SASL exchange allows for server
  # challenges and client responses, but many mechanisms expect the client to
  # "respond" first.  The initial response will only be sent for
  # "client-first" mechanisms.
  #
  # Server capabilities may change after #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
  # Previously cached #capabilities will be cleared when this method
  # completes.  If the TaggedResponse to #authenticate includes updated
  # capabilities, they will be cached.

  # ==== Capabilities
  #

  # or +IMAP4REV2+ [RFC9051[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051]].
  #
  # Additionally, the server capabilities must include a capability matching
  # each enabled extension (usually the same name as the enabled extension).
  # The following capabilities may be enabled:
  #
  # [+CONDSTORE+ {[RFC7162]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html]]
  #
  #   Updates various commands to return +CONDSTORE+ extension responses.  It
  #   is not necessary to explicitly enable +CONDSTORE+—using any of the
  #   command parameters defined by the extension will implicitly enable it.
  #   See {[RFC7162 §3.1]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html#section-3.1].
  #
  # [+QRESYNC+ {[RFC7162]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html]]
  #   *NOTE:* Enabling QRESYNC will replace +EXPUNGE+ with +VANISHED+, but
  #   the extension arguments to #select, #examine, and #uid_fetch are not
  #   supported yet.
  #
  #   Adds quick resynchronization options to #select, #examine, and
  #   #uid_fetch.  +QRESYNC+ _must_ be explicitly enabled before using any of
  #   the extension's command parameters.  All +EXPUNGE+ responses will be
  #   replaced with +VANISHED+ responses.  Enabling +QRESYNC+ implicitly
  #   enables +CONDSTORE+ as well.
  #   See {[RFC7162 §3.2]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html#section-3.2].
  #
  # [+:utf8+ --- an alias for <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt>]
  #
  #   In a future release, <tt>enable(:utf8)</tt> will enable either
  #   <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> or <tt>"IMAP4rev2"</tt>, depending on server
  #   capabilities.
  #
  # [<tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> [RFC6855[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6855]]]
  #
  #   The server's capabilities must include <tt>UTF8=ACCEPT</tt> _or_
  #   <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt>.
  #
  #   This allows the server to send strings encoded as UTF-8 which might
  #   otherwise need to use a 7-bit encoding, such as {modified
  #   UTF-7}[::decode_utf7] for mailbox names, or RFC2047 encoded-words for
  #   message headers.
  #
  #   *Note:* <em>A future update may set string encodings slightly
  #   differently</em>, e.g: "US-ASCII" when UTF-8 is not enabled, and "UTF-8"
  #   when it is.  Currently, the encoding of strings sent as "quoted" or
  #   "text" will _always_ be "UTF-8", even when only ASCII characters are
  #   used (e.g. "Subject: Agenda") And currently, string "literals" sent
  #   by the server will always have an "ASCII-8BIT" (binary)
  #   encoding, even if they generally contain UTF-8 data, if they are
  #   text at all.
  #
  # [<tt>"UTF8=ONLY"</tt> [RFC6855[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6855]]]
  #
  #   A server that reports the <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt> capability _requires_ that
  #   the client <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt> before any mailboxes may be
  #   selected.  For convenience, <tt>enable("UTF8=ONLY")</tt> is aliased to
  #   <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt>.
  #
  # [+UIDONLY+ {[RFC9586]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9586.pdf]]
  #
  #   When UIDONLY is enabled, the #fetch, #store, #search, #copy, and #move
  #   commands are prohibited and result in a tagged BAD response. Clients
  #   should instead use uid_fetch, uid_store, uid_search, uid_copy, or
  #   uid_move, respectively. All +FETCH+ responses that would be returned are
  #   replaced by +UIDFETCH+ responses. All +EXPUNGED+ responses that would be
  #   returned are replaced by +VANISHED+ responses. The "<sequence set>"
  #   uid_search criterion is prohibited.
  #
  # ===== Unsupported capabilities
  #
  # *Note:* Some extensions that use ENABLE permit the server to send syntax
  # that Net::IMAP cannot parse, which may raise an exception and disconnect.
  # Some extensions may work, but the support may be incomplete, untested, or
  # experimental.
  #
  # Until a capability is documented here as supported, enabling it may result
  # in undocumented behavior and a future release may update with incompatible
  # behavior <em>without warning or deprecation</em>.
  #
  # <em>Caution is advised.</em>

  # common case, the naive client may not have any trouble naming mailboxes.
  # But many servers are configured with the default personal namespace as
  # e.g.  <tt>("INBOX." ".")</tt>, placing all personal folders under INBOX,
  # with "+.+" as the hierarchy delimiter. If the client does not check for
  # this, but naively assumes it can use the same folder names for all
  # servers, then folder creation (and listing, moving, etc) can lead to

  #    a certain mailbox, there can be circumstances where it is unclear which
  #    Personal Namespaces it should create the mailbox in.  In these

  #   responses hash.
  #
  # ==== Clearing responses
  #
  # Previously unhandled responses are automatically cleared before entering a
  # mailbox with #select or #examine.  Long-lived connections can receive many
  # unhandled server responses, which must be pruned or they will continually

  #
  # Sends a {SEARCH command [IMAP4rev1 §6.4.4]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501#section-6.4.4]
  # to search the mailbox for messages that match the given search +criteria+,
  # and returns either a SearchResult or an ESearchResult.  SearchResult
  # inherits from Array (for backward compatibility) but adds
  # SearchResult#modseq when the +CONDSTORE+ capability has been enabled.
  # ESearchResult also implements {#to_a}[rdoc-ref:ESearchResult#to_a], for
  # compatibility with SearchResult.
  #
  # +criteria+ is one or more search keys and their arguments, which may be
  # provided as an array or a string.
  # See {"Argument translation"}[rdoc-ref:#search@Argument+translation]
  # and {"Search criteria"}[rdoc-ref:#search@Search+criteria], below.
  #
  # +return+ options control what kind of information is returned about
  # messages matching the search +criteria+.  Specifying +return+ should force
  # the server to return an ESearchResult instead of a SearchResult, but some
  # servers disobey this requirement.  <em>Requires an extended search
  # capability, such as +ESEARCH+ or +IMAP4rev2+.</em>
  # See {"Argument translation"}[rdoc-ref:#search@Argument+translation] and
  # {"Supported return options"}[rdoc-ref:#search@Supported+return+options],
  # below.
  #
  # +charset+ is the name of the {registered character
  # set}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml]
  # used by strings in the search +criteria+.  When +charset+ isn't specified,
  # either <tt>"US-ASCII"</tt> or <tt>"UTF-8"</tt> is assumed, depending on
  # the server's capabilities.
  #
  # _NOTE:_ Return options and charset may be sent as part of +criteria+.  Do
  # not use the +return+ or +charset+ arguments when either return options or
  # charset are embedded in +criteria+.

  # Sending charset as the second positional argument is supported for
  # backward compatibility.  Future versions may print a deprecation warning:
  #    imap.search(%w(OR UNSEEN FLAGGED), "UTF-8", return: %w(MIN MAX))
  #
  # ==== Argument translation
  #
  # [+return+ options]
  #   Must be an Array.  Return option names may be either strings or symbols.
  #   +Range+ elements which begin and end with negative integers are encoded
  #   for use with +PARTIAL+--any other ranges are converted to SequenceSet.
  #   Unlike +criteria+, other return option arguments are not automatically
  #   converted to SequenceSet.
  #
  # [When +criteria+ is an Array]
  #   When the array begins with <tt>"RETURN"</tt> (case insensitive), the
  #   second array element is translated like the +return+ parameter (as
  #   described above).
  #
  #   Every other member is a +SEARCH+ command argument:
  #   [SequenceSet]
  #     Encoded as an \IMAP +sequence-set+ with SequenceSet#valid_string.
  #   [Set, Range, <tt>-1</tt>, +:*+, responds to +#to_sequence_set+]
  #     Converted to SequenceSet for validation and encoding.
  #   [nested sequence-set +Array+]
  #     When every element in a nested array is one of the above types, a
  #     positive +Integer+, a sequence-set formatted +String+, or a deeply
  #     nested +Array+ of these same types, the array will be converted to
  #     SequenceSet for validation and encoding.
  #   [Any other nested +Array+]
  #     Otherwise, a nested array is encoded as a parenthesized list, to
  #     combine multiple search keys (e.g., for use with +OR+ and +NOT+).
  #   [+String+]
  #     Sent verbatim when it is a valid \IMAP +atom+, and encoded as an \IMAP
  #     +quoted+ or +literal+ string otherwise.  Every standard search key
  #     name is a valid \IMAP +atom+ and every standard search key string
  #     argument is an +astring+ which may be encoded as +atom+, +quoted+, or
  #     +literal+.
  #
  #     *Note:* <tt>*</tt> is not a valid \IMAP +atom+ character.  Any string
  #     containing <tt>*</tt> will be encoded as a +quoted+ string, _not_ a
  #     +sequence-set+.
  #   [+Integer+ (except for <tt>-1</tt>)]
  #     Encoded using +#to_s+.
  #   [+Date+]
  #     Encoded as an \IMAP date (see ::encode_date).
  #
  # [When +criteria+ is a String]
  #   +criteria+ will be sent directly to the server <em>without any
  #   validation or encoding</em>.
  #
  #   <em>*WARNING:* This is vulnerable to injection attacks when external
  #   inputs are used.</em>
  #
  # ==== Supported return options
  #
  # For full definitions of the standard return options and return data, see
  # the relevant RFCs.
  #
  # [+ALL+]
  #    Returns ESearchResult#all with a SequenceSet of all matching sequence
  #    numbers or UIDs.  This is the default, when return options are empty.
  #
  #    For compatibility with SearchResult, ESearchResult#to_a returns an
  #    Array of message sequence numbers or UIDs.

# The versioned default configs inherit certain specific config options from
# Config.global, for example #debug:
#
#   client = Net::IMAP.new(hostname, config: 0.4)
#   Net::IMAP.debug = false
#   client.config.debug?  # => false
#
#   Net::IMAP.debug = true
#   client.config.debug?  # => true
#
# Use #load_defaults to globally behave like a specific version:
#   client = Net::IMAP.new(hostname)
#   client.config.sasl_ir              # => true
#   Net::IMAP.config.load_defaults 0.3
#   client.config.sasl_ir              # => false
#
# === Named defaults
# In addition to +x.y+ version numbers, the following aliases are supported:
#
# [+:default+]
#   An alias for +:current+.
#
#   >>>
#   *NOTE*: This is _not_ the same as Config.default.  It inherits some
#   attributes from Config.global, for example: #debug.
# [+:current+]
#   An alias for the current +x.y+ version's defaults.
# [+:next+]
#   The _planned_ config for the next +x.y+ version.
# [+:future+]
#   The _planned_ eventual config for some future +x.y+ version.
#
# For example, to disable all currently deprecated behavior:
#   client = Net::IMAP.new(hostname, config: :future)
#   client.config.response_without_args     # => :frozen_dup
#   client.responses.frozen?                # => true
#   client.responses.values.all?(&:frozen?) # => true
#
# == Thread Safety
#
# *NOTE:* Updates to config objects are not synchronized for thread-safety.

#
# === Fetch attributes
#
# See {[IMAP4rev1 §7.4.2]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.html#section-7.4.2]
# and {[IMAP4rev2 §7.5.2]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html#section-7.5.2]
# for a full description of the standard fetch response data items, and
# Net::IMAP@Message+envelope+and+body+structure for other relevant RFCs.
#
# ==== Static fetch data items
#
# Most message attributes are static, and must never change for a given
# <tt>(server, account, mailbox, UIDVALIDITY, UID)</tt> tuple.
#
# The static fetch data items defined by both
# IMAP4rev1[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.html] and
# IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html] are:
#
# * <b><tt>"UID"</tt></b> --- See #uid.
# * <b><tt>"BODY"</tt></b> --- See #body.
# * <b><tt>"BODY[#{section_spec}]"</tt></b>,
#   <b><tt>"BODY[#{section_spec}]<#{offset}>"</tt></b> --- See #message,
#   #part, #header, #header_fields, #header_fields_not, #mime, and #text.
# * <b><tt>"BODYSTRUCTURE"</tt></b> --- See #bodystructure.
# * <b><tt>"ENVELOPE"</tt></b> --- See #envelope.
# * <b><tt>"INTERNALDATE"</tt></b> --- See #internaldate.
# * <b><tt>"RFC822.SIZE"</tt></b> --- See #rfc822_size.
#
# IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html] adds the
# additional fetch items from the +BINARY+ extension
# {[RFC3516]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3516.html]:
#
# * <b><tt>"BINARY[#{part}]"</tt></b>,
#   <b><tt>"BINARY[#{part}]<#{offset}>"</tt></b> -- See #binary.
# * <b><tt>"BINARY.SIZE[#{part}]"</tt></b> -- See #binary_size.
#
# Several static message attributes in
# IMAP4rev1[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.html] are obsolete and
# been removed from
# IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html]:
#
# * <b><tt>"RFC822"</tt></b> --- See #rfc822 or replace with
#   <tt>"BODY[]"</tt> and #message.
# * <b><tt>"RFC822.HEADER"</tt></b> --- See #rfc822_header or replace with
#   <tt>"BODY[HEADER]"</tt> and #header.
# * <b><tt>"RFC822.TEXT"</tt></b> --- See #rfc822_text or replace with
#   <tt>"BODY[TEXT]"</tt> and #text.
#
# Net::IMAP supports static attributes defined by the following extensions:
# * +OBJECTID+ {[RFC8474]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8474.html]
#   * <b><tt>"EMAILID"</tt></b> --- See #emailid.
#   * <b><tt>"THREADID"</tt></b> --- See #threadid.
#
# * +X-GM-EXT-1+ {[non-standard Gmail
#   extension]}[https://developers.google.com/gmail/imap/imap-extensions]
#   * <b><tt>"X-GM-MSGID"</tt></b> --- unique message ID.  Access via #attr.
#   * <b><tt>"X-GM-THRID"</tt></b> --- Thread ID.  Access via #attr.
#
# [NOTE:]
#     Additional static fields are defined in other \IMAP extensions, but
#     Net::IMAP can't parse them yet.
#
# ==== Dynamic message attributes
#
# Some message attributes can be dynamically changed, for example using the
# {STORE command}[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP#store].
#
# The only dynamic message attribute defined by
# IMAP4rev1[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.html] and
# IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html] is:
#
# * <b><tt>"FLAGS"</tt></b> --- See #flags.
#
# Net::IMAP supports dynamic attributes defined by the following extensions:
#
# * +CONDSTORE+ {[RFC7162]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html]:
#   * <b><tt>"MODSEQ"</tt></b> --- See #modseq.
# * +X-GM-EXT-1+ {[non-standard Gmail
#   extension]}[https://developers.google.com/gmail/imap/imap-extensions]
#   * <b><tt>"X-GM-LABELS"</tt></b> --- Gmail labels.  Access via #attr.
#
# [NOTE:]
#     Additional dynamic fields are defined in other \IMAP extensions, but
#     Net::IMAP can't parse them yet.
#
# === Implicitly setting <tt>\Seen</tt> and using +PEEK+
#
# Unless the mailbox has been opened as read-only, fetching
# <tt>BODY[#{section}]</tt> or <tt>BINARY[#{section}]</tt>
# will implicitly set the <tt>\Seen</tt> flag.  To avoid this, fetch using
# <tt>BODY.PEEK[#{section}]</tt> or <tt>BINARY.PEEK[#{section}]</tt>
# instead.
#
# [NOTE:]
#   The data will always be _returned_ without the <tt>".PEEK"</tt> suffix,
#   as <tt>BODY[#{specifier}]</tt> or <tt>BINARY[#{section}]</tt>.

# Pluggable authentication mechanisms for protocols which support SASL
# (Simple Authentication and Security Layer), such as IMAP4, SMTP, LDAP, and
# XMPP.  {RFC-4422}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4422] specifies the
# common \SASL framework:
# >>>
#   SASL is conceptually a framework that provides an abstraction layer
#   between protocols and mechanisms as illustrated in the following
#   diagram.
#
#               SMTP    LDAP    XMPP   Other protocols ...
#                  \       |    |      /
#                   \      |    |     /
#                  SASL abstraction layer
#                   /      |    |     \
#                  /       |    |      \
#           EXTERNAL   GSSAPI  PLAIN   Other mechanisms ...
#
# Net::IMAP uses SASL via the Net::IMAP#authenticate method.
#
# == Mechanisms
#
# Each mechanism has different properties and requirements.  Please consult
# the documentation for the specific mechanisms you are using:
#
# +ANONYMOUS+::
#     See AnonymousAuthenticator.
#
#     Allows the user to gain access to public services or resources without
#     authenticating or disclosing an identity.
#
# +EXTERNAL+::
#     See ExternalAuthenticator.
#
#     Authenticates using already established credentials, such as a TLS
#     certificate or IPSec.
#
# +OAUTHBEARER+::
#     See OAuthBearerAuthenticator.
#
#     Login using an OAuth2 Bearer token.  This is the standard mechanism
#     for using OAuth2 with \SASL, but it is not yet deployed as widely as
#     +XOAUTH2+.
#
# +PLAIN+::
#     See PlainAuthenticator.
#
#     Login using clear-text username and password.
#
# +SCRAM-SHA-1+::
# +SCRAM-SHA-256+::
#     See ScramAuthenticator.
#
#     Login by username and password.  The password is not sent to the
#     server but is used in a salted challenge/response exchange.
#     +SCRAM-SHA-1+ and +SCRAM-SHA-256+ are directly supported by
#     Net::IMAP::SASL.  New authenticators can easily be added for any other
#     <tt>SCRAM-*</tt> mechanism if the digest algorithm is supported by
#     OpenSSL::Digest.
#
# +XOAUTH2+::
#     See XOAuth2Authenticator.
#
#     Login using a username and an OAuth2 access token.  Non-standard and
#     obsoleted by +OAUTHBEARER+, but widely supported.
#
# See the {SASL mechanism
# registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml]
# for a list of all SASL mechanisms and their specifications.  To register
# new authenticators, see Authenticators.
#
# === Deprecated mechanisms
#
# <em>Obsolete mechanisms should be avoided, but are still available for
# backwards compatibility.</em>
#
# >>>
#   For +DIGEST-MD5+ see DigestMD5Authenticator.
#
#   For +LOGIN+, see LoginAuthenticator.
#
#   For +CRAM-MD5+, see CramMD5Authenticator.

  #   _optional_ #username — An alias for #authzid.
  #
  #   Note that, unlike some other authenticators, +username+ sets the
  #   _authorization_ identity and not the _authentication_ identity.  The
  #   authentication identity is established for the client by the OAuth
  #   token.
  #
  # * _optional_ #host — Hostname to which the client connected.
  # * _optional_ #port — Service port to which the client connected.
  # * _optional_ #mthd — HTTP method
  # * _optional_ #path — HTTP path data
  # * _optional_ #post — HTTP post data
  # * _optional_ #qs   — HTTP query string

# Abstract base class for the "+SCRAM-*+" family of SASL mechanisms,
# defined in RFC5802[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5802].  Use via
# Net::IMAP#authenticate.
#
# Directly supported:
# * +SCRAM-SHA-1+   --- ScramSHA1Authenticator
# * +SCRAM-SHA-256+ --- ScramSHA256Authenticator
#
# New +SCRAM-*+ mechanisms can easily be added for any hash algorithm
# supported by
# OpenSSL::Digest[https://ruby.github.io/openssl/OpenSSL/Digest.html].
# Subclasses need only set an appropriate +DIGEST_NAME+ constant.
#
# === SCRAM algorithm
#
# See the documentation and method definitions on ScramAlgorithm for an
# overview of the algorithm.  The different mechanisms differ only by
# which hash function that is used (or by support for channel binding with
# +-PLUS+).
#
# See also the methods on GS2Header.
#
# ==== Server messages
#
# As server messages are received, they are validated and loaded into
# the various attributes, e.g: #snonce, #salt, #iterations, #verifier,
# #server_error, etc.
#
# Unlike many other SASL mechanisms, the +SCRAM-*+ family supports mutual
# authentication and can return server error data in the server messages.
# If #process raises an Error for the server-final-message, then
# server_error may contain error details.
#
# === TLS Channel binding
#
# <em>The <tt>SCRAM-*-PLUS</tt> mechanisms and channel binding are not
# supported yet.</em>
#
# === Caching SCRAM secrets
#
# <em>Caching of salted_password, client_key, stored_key, and server_key
# is not supported yet.</em>

#
# == Ordered and Normalized sets
#
# Sometimes the order of the set's members is significant, such as with the
# +ESORT+, <tt>CONTEXT=SORT</tt>, and +UIDPLUS+ extensions.  So, when a
# sequence set is created from a single string (such as by the parser), that
# #string representation is preserved.  Assigning a string with #string= or
# #replace will also preserve that string.  Use #each_entry, #entries, or
# #each_ordered_number to enumerate the entries in their #string order.
# Hash equality (using #eql?) is based on the string representation.
#
# Internally, SequenceSet uses a normalized uint32 set representation which
# sorts and de-duplicates all numbers and coalesces adjacent or overlapping
# entries.  Many methods use this sorted set representation for <tt>O(lg
# n)</tt> searches.  Use #each_element, #elements, #each_range, #ranges,
# #each_number, or #numbers to enumerate the set in sorted order.  Basic
# object equality (using #==) is based on set membership, without regard to
# #entry order or #string normalization.
#
# Most modification methods reset #string to its #normalized form, so that
# #entries and #elements are identical.  Use #append to preserve #entries
# order while modifying a set.
#
# Non-normalized sets store both representations of the set, which can more
# than double memory usage.  Very large sequence sets should avoid
# denormalizing methods (such as #append) unless order is significant.
#
# == Using <tt>*</tt>
#
# \IMAP sequence sets may contain a special value <tt>"*"</tt>, which
# represents the largest number in use.  From +seq-number+ in
# {RFC9051 §9}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html#section-9-5]:
# >>>
#   In the case of message sequence numbers, it is the number of messages
#   in a non-empty mailbox.  In the case of unique identifiers, it is the
#   unique identifier of the last message in the mailbox or, if the
#   mailbox is empty, the mailbox's current UIDNEXT value.
#
# When creating a SequenceSet, <tt>*</tt> may be input as <tt>-1</tt>,
# <tt>"*"</tt>, <tt>:*</tt>, an endless range, or a range ending in
# <tt>-1</tt>.  When converting to #elements, #ranges, or #numbers, it will
# output as either <tt>:*</tt> or an endless range.  For example:
#
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["1,3,*"].to_a      #=> [1, 3, :*]
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["1,234:*"].to_a    #=> [1, 234..]
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1234..-1].to_a     #=> [1234..]
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1234..].to_a       #=> [1234..]
#
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1234..].to_s       #=> "1234:*"
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1234..-1].to_s     #=> "1234:*"
#
# Use #limit to convert <tt>"*"</tt> to a maximum value.  When a range
# includes <tt>"*"</tt>, the maximum value will always be matched:
#
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["9999:*"].limit(max: 25)
#   #=> Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["25"]
#
# === Surprising <tt>*</tt> behavior
#
# When a set includes <tt>*</tt>, some methods may have surprising behavior.
#
# For example, #complement treats <tt>*</tt> as its own member.  This way,
# the #intersection of a set and its #complement will always be empty.  And
# <tt>*</tt> is sorted as greater than any other number in the set.  This is
# not how an \IMAP server interprets the set: it will convert <tt>*</tt> to
# the number of messages in the mailbox, the +UID+ of the last message in
# the mailbox, or +UIDNEXT+, as appropriate.  Several methods have an
# argument for how <tt>*</tt> should be interpreted.
#
# But, for example, this means that there may be overlap between a set and
# its complement after #limit is applied to each:
#
#   ~Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["*"]  == Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1..(2**32-1)]
#   ~Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1..5] == Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["6:*"]
#
#   set = Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1..5]
#   (set & ~set).empty? => true
#
#   (set.limit(max: 4) & (~set).limit(max: 4)).to_a => [4]
#
# When counting the number of numbers in a set, <tt>*</tt> will be counted
# as if it were equal to UINT32_MAX:
#   UINT32_MAX = 2**32 - 1
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["*"].count                   => 1
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1..UINT32_MAX - 1, :*].count => UINT32_MAX
#
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet["1:*"].count                 => UINT32_MAX
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[UINT32_MAX, :*].count        => 1
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[UINT32_MAX..].count          => 1
#
# Use #cardinality to count the set members wxth <tt>*</tt> counted as a
# distinct member:
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[1..].cardinality            #=> UINT32_MAX + 1
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[UINT32_MAX, :*].cardinality #=> 2
#   Net::IMAP::SequenceSet[UINT32_MAX..].cardinality   #=> 2

  # * ::try_convert calls +to_sequence_set+ on inputs that support it and
  #   returns +nil+ for inputs that don't.
  # * ::empty and ::full both return frozen singleton sets which can be
