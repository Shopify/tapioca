# An Engine with the responsibility of coordinating the whole boot process.
#
# == Initialization
#
# Rails::Application is responsible for executing all railties and engines
# initializers. It also executes some bootstrap initializers (check
# Rails::Application::Bootstrap) and finishing initializers, after all the others
# are executed (check Rails::Application::Finisher).
#
# == Configuration
#
# Besides providing the same configuration as Rails::Engine and Rails::Railtie,
# the application object has several specific configurations, for example
# "cache_classes", "consider_all_requests_local", "filter_parameters",
# "logger" and so forth.
#
# Check Rails::Application::Configuration to see them all.
#
# == Routes
#
# The application object is also responsible for holding the routes and reloading routes
# whenever the files change in development.
#
# == Middlewares
#
# The Application is also responsible for building the middleware stack.
#
# == Booting process
#
# The application is also responsible for setting up and executing the booting
# process. From the moment you require "config/application.rb" in your app,
# the booting process goes like this:
#
# 1)  require "config/boot.rb" to set up load paths
# 2)  require railties and engines
# 3)  Define Rails.application as "class MyApp::Application < Rails::Application"
# 4)  Run config.before_configuration callbacks
# 5)  Load config/environments/ENV.rb
# 6)  Run config.before_initialize callbacks
# 7)  Run Railtie#initializer defined by railties, engines and application.
# One by one, each engine sets up its load paths, routes and runs its config/initializers/* files.
# 8)  Custom Railtie#initializers added by railties, engines and applications are executed
# 9)  Build the middleware stack and run to_prepare callbacks
# 10) Run config.before_eager_load and eager_load! if eager_load is true
# 11) Run config.after_initialize callbacks
#
# == Multiple Applications
#
# If you decide to define multiple applications, then the first application
# that is initialized will be set to +Rails.application+, unless you override
# it with a different application.
#
# To create a new application, you can instantiate a new instance of a class
# that has already been created:
#
# class Application < Rails::Application
# end
#
# first_application  = Application.new
# second_application = Application.new(config: first_application.config)
#
# In the above example, the configuration from the first application was used
# to initialize the second application. You can also use the +initialize_copy+
# on one of the applications to create a copy of the application which shares
# the configuration.
#
# If you decide to define Rake tasks, runners, or initializers in an
# application other than +Rails.application+, then you must run them manually.
class Rails::Application < ::Rails::Engine
  def initialize(initial_variable_values = T.unsafe(nil), &block); end

  # Convenience for loading config/foo.yml for the current Rails env.

  #
  # # config/environments/production.rb
  # Rails.application.configure do
  # config.middleware.use ExceptionNotifier, config_for(:exception_notification)
  # end
  #
  # # You can also store configurations in a shared section which will be
  # # merged with the environment configuration
  #
  # # config/example.yml
  # shared:
  # foo:
  # bar:

  # development:
  # foo:

  # If specific credentials file exists for current environment, it takes precedence, thus for +production+
  # environment look first for +config/credentials/production.yml.enc+ with master key taken

  # a key in the +ENV+, use:

  # Rails.application.encrypted("config/special_tokens.yml.enc", env_key: "SPECIAL_TOKENS")
  #
  # Or to decrypt with a file, that should be version control ignored, relative to +Rails.root+:

Rails::Application::INITIAL_VARIABLES = T.let(T.unsafe(nil), Array)

# <tt>Rails::Engine</tt> allows you to wrap a specific Rails application or subset of
# functionality and share it with other applications or within a larger packaged application.
# Every <tt>Rails::Application</tt> is just an engine, which allows for simple
# feature and application sharing.
#
# Any <tt>Rails::Engine</tt> is also a <tt>Rails::Railtie</tt>, so the same
# methods (like <tt>rake_tasks</tt> and +generators+) and configuration
# options that are available in railties can also be used in engines.
#
# == Creating an Engine
#
# If you want a gem to behave as an engine, you have to specify an +Engine+
# for it somewhere inside your plugin's +lib+ folder (similar to how we
# specify a +Railtie+):
#
# # lib/my_engine.rb
# module MyEngine
# class Engine < Rails::Engine
# end
# end
#
# Then ensure that this file is loaded at the top of your <tt>config/application.rb</tt>
# (or in your +Gemfile+) and it will automatically load models, controllers and helpers
# inside +app+, load routes at <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>, load locales at
# <tt>config/locales/*</tt>, and load tasks at <tt>lib/tasks/*</tt>.
#
# == Configuration
#
# Like railties, engines can access a config object which contains configuration shared by
# all railties and the application.
# Additionally, each engine can access <tt>autoload_paths</tt>, <tt>eager_load_paths</tt> and
# <tt>autoload_once_paths</tt> settings which are scoped to that engine.
#
# class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
# # Add a load path for this specific Engine
# config.autoload_paths << File.expand_path("lib/some/path", __dir__)
#
# initializer "my_engine.add_middleware" do |app|
# app.middleware.use MyEngine::Middleware
# end
# end
#
# == Generators
#
# You can set up generators for engines with <tt>config.generators</tt> method:
#
# class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
# config.generators do |g|
# g.orm             :active_record
# g.template_engine :erb
# g.test_framework  :test_unit
# end
# end
#
# You can also set generators for an application by using <tt>config.app_generators</tt>:
#
# class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
# # note that you can also pass block to app_generators in the same way you
# # can pass it to generators method
# config.app_generators.orm :datamapper
# end
#
# == Paths
#
# Applications and engines have flexible path configuration, meaning that you
# are not required to place your controllers at <tt>app/controllers</tt>, but
# in any place which you find convenient.
#
# For example, let's suppose you want to place your controllers in <tt>lib/controllers</tt>.
# You can set that as an option:
#
# class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
# paths["app/controllers"] = "lib/controllers"
# end
#
# You can also have your controllers loaded from both <tt>app/controllers</tt> and
# <tt>lib/controllers</tt>:
#
# class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
# paths["app/controllers"] << "lib/controllers"
# end
#
# The available paths in an engine are:
#
# class MyEngine < Rails::Engine
# paths["app"]                 # => ["app"]
# paths["app/controllers"]     # => ["app/controllers"]
# paths["app/helpers"]         # => ["app/helpers"]

# end
#
# The <tt>Application</tt> class adds a couple more paths to this set. And as in your
# <tt>Application</tt>, all folders under +app+ are automatically added to the load path.
# If you have an <tt>app/services</tt> folder for example, it will be added by default.
#
# == Endpoint
#
# An engine can also be a Rack application. It can be useful if you have a Rack application that
# you would like to provide with some of the +Engine+'s features.
#
# To do that, use the +endpoint+ method:
#
# module MyEngine
# class Engine < Rails::Engine
# endpoint MyRackApplication
# end
# end
#
# Now you can mount your engine in application's routes:
#
# Rails.application.routes.draw do
# mount MyEngine::Engine => "/engine"
# end
#
# == Middleware stack
#
# As an engine can now be a Rack endpoint, it can also have a middleware
# stack. The usage is exactly the same as in <tt>Application</tt>:
#
# module MyEngine
# class Engine < Rails::Engine
# middleware.use SomeMiddleware
# end
# end
#
# == Routes
#
# If you don't specify an endpoint, routes will be used as the default
# endpoint. You can use them just like you use an application's routes:
#
# # ENGINE/config/routes.rb
# MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
# get "/" => "posts#index"
# end
#
# == Mount priority
#
# Note that now there can be more than one router in your application, and it's better to avoid
# passing requests through many routers. Consider this situation:
#
# Rails.application.routes.draw do
# mount MyEngine::Engine => "/blog"
# get "/blog/omg" => "main#omg"
# end
#
# +MyEngine+ is mounted at <tt>/blog</tt>, and <tt>/blog/omg</tt> points to application's
# controller. In such a situation, requests to <tt>/blog/omg</tt> will go through +MyEngine+,
# and if there is no such route in +Engine+'s routes, it will be dispatched to <tt>main#omg</tt>.
# It's much better to swap that:
#
# Rails.application.routes.draw do
# get "/blog/omg" => "main#omg"
# mount MyEngine::Engine => "/blog"
# end
#
# Now, +Engine+ will get only requests that were not handled by +Application+.
#
# == Engine name
#
# There are some places where an Engine's name is used:
#
# * routes: when you mount an Engine with <tt>mount(MyEngine::Engine => '/my_engine')</tt>,
# it's used as default <tt>:as</tt> option
# * rake task for installing migrations <tt>my_engine:install:migrations</tt>
#
# Engine name is set by default based on class name. For <tt>MyEngine::Engine</tt> it will be
# <tt>my_engine_engine</tt>. You can change it manually using the <tt>engine_name</tt> method:
#
# module MyEngine
# class Engine < Rails::Engine
# engine_name "my_engine"
# end
# end
#
# == Isolated Engine
#
# Normally when you create controllers, helpers and models inside an engine, they are treated
# as if they were created inside the application itself. This means that all helpers and
# named routes from the application will be available to your engine's controllers as well.
#
# However, sometimes you want to isolate your engine from the application, especially if your engine
# has its own router. To do that, you simply need to call +isolate_namespace+. This method requires
# you to pass a module where all your controllers, helpers and models should be nested to:
#
# module MyEngine
# class Engine < Rails::Engine
# isolate_namespace MyEngine
# end
# end
#
# With such an engine, everything that is inside the +MyEngine+ module will be isolated from
# the application.
#
# Consider this controller:
#
# module MyEngine
# class FooController < ActionController::Base
# end
# end
#
# If the +MyEngine+ engine is marked as isolated, +FooController+ only has
# access to helpers from +MyEngine+, and <tt>url_helpers</tt> from
# <tt>MyEngine::Engine.routes</tt>.
#
# The next thing that changes in isolated engines is the behavior of routes.
# Normally, when you namespace your controllers, you also need to namespace
# the related routes. With an isolated engine, the engine's namespace is
# automatically applied, so you don't need to specify it explicitly in your
# routes:
#
# MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
# resources :articles
# end
#
# If +MyEngine+ is isolated, the routes above will point to
# <tt>MyEngine::ArticlesController</tt>. You also don't need to use longer
# URL helpers like +my_engine_articles_path+. Instead, you should simply use
# +articles_path+, like you would do with your main application.
#
# To make this behavior consistent with other parts of the framework,
# isolated engines also have an effect on <tt>ActiveModel::Naming</tt>. In a
# normal Rails app, when you use a namespaced model such as
# <tt>Namespace::Article</tt>, <tt>ActiveModel::Naming</tt> will generate
# names with the prefix "namespace". In an isolated engine, the prefix will
# be omitted in URL helpers and form fields, for convenience.
#
# polymorphic_url(MyEngine::Article.new)
# # => "articles_path" # not "my_engine_articles_path"
#
# form_for(MyEngine::Article.new) do
# text_field :title # => <input type="text" name="article[title]" id="article_title" />
# end
#
# Additionally, an isolated engine will set its own name according to its
# namespace, so <tt>MyEngine::Engine.engine_name</tt> will return
# "my_engine". It will also set +MyEngine.table_name_prefix+ to "my_engine_",
# meaning for example that <tt>MyEngine::Article</tt> will use the
# +my_engine_articles+ database table by default.
#
# == Using Engine's routes outside Engine
#
# Since you can now mount an engine inside application's routes, you do not have direct access to +Engine+'s
# <tt>url_helpers</tt> inside +Application+. When you mount an engine in an application's routes, a special helper is
# created to allow you to do that. Consider such a scenario:
#
# # config/routes.rb
# Rails.application.routes.draw do
# mount MyEngine::Engine => "/my_engine", as: "my_engine"
# get "/foo" => "foo#index"
# end
#
# Now, you can use the <tt>my_engine</tt> helper inside your application:
#
# class FooController < ApplicationController
# def index
# my_engine.root_url # => /my_engine/
# end
# end
#
# There is also a <tt>main_app</tt> helper that gives you access to application's routes inside Engine:
#
# module MyEngine
# class BarController
# def index
# main_app.foo_path # => /foo
# end
# end
# end
#
# Note that the <tt>:as</tt> option given to mount takes the <tt>engine_name</tt> as default, so most of the time
# you can simply omit it.
#
# Finally, if you want to generate a URL to an engine's route using
# <tt>polymorphic_url</tt>, you also need to pass the engine helper. Let's
# say that you want to create a form pointing to one of the engine's routes.
# All you need to do is pass the helper as the first element in array with
# attributes for URL:
#
# form_for([my_engine, @user])
#
# This code will use <tt>my_engine.user_path(@user)</tt> to generate the proper route.
#
# == Isolated engine's helpers
#
# Sometimes you may want to isolate engine, but use helpers that are defined for it.
# If you want to share just a few specific helpers you can add them to application's
# helpers in ApplicationController:
#
# class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
# helper MyEngine::SharedEngineHelper
# end
#
# If you want to include all of the engine's helpers, you can use the #helper method on an engine's
# instance:
#
# class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
# helper MyEngine::Engine.helpers
# end
#
# It will include all of the helpers from engine's directory. Take into account this does
# not include helpers defined in controllers with helper_method or other similar solutions,
# only helpers defined in the helpers directory will be included.
#
# == Migrations & seed data
#
# Engines can have their own migrations. The default path for migrations is exactly the same
# as in application: <tt>db/migrate</tt>
#
# To use engine's migrations in application you can use the rake task below, which copies them to
# application's dir:
#
# rake ENGINE_NAME:install:migrations
#
# Note that some of the migrations may be skipped if a migration with the same name already exists
# in application. In such a situation you must decide whether to leave that migration or rename the
# migration in the application and rerun copying migrations.
#
# If your engine has migrations, you may also want to prepare data for the database in
# the <tt>db/seeds.rb</tt> file. You can load that data using the <tt>load_seed</tt> method, e.g.
#
# MyEngine::Engine.load_seed
#
# == Loading priority
#
# In order to change engine's priority you can use +config.railties_order+ in the main application.
# It will affect the priority of loading views, helpers, assets, and all the other files
# related to engine or application.
#
# # load Blog::Engine with highest priority, followed by application and other railties
# config.railties_order = [Blog::Engine, :main_app, :all]
