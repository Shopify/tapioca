# Generic connection pool class for sharing a limited number of objects or network connections
# among many threads.  Note: pool elements are lazily created.
#
# Example usage with block (faster):
#
# @pool = ConnectionPool.new { Redis.new }
# @pool.with do |redis|
# redis.lpop('my-list') if redis.llen('my-list') > 0
# end
#
# Using optional timeout override (for that single invocation)
#
# @pool.with(timeout: 2.0) do |redis|
# redis.lpop('my-list') if redis.llen('my-list') > 0
# end
#
# Example usage replacing an existing connection (slower):
#
# $redis = ConnectionPool.wrap { Redis.new }
#
# def do_work
# $redis.lpop('my-list') if $redis.llen('my-list') > 0
# end
#
# Accepts the following options:
# - :size - number of connections to pool, defaults to 5
# - :timeout - amount of time to wait for a connection if none currently available, defaults to 5 seconds

  # Number of pool entries available for checkout at this instant.

  # removing it the pool. Subsequent checkouts will create new connections as
  # needed.
  def reload(&block); end

  # Shuts down the ConnectionPool by passing each connection to +block+ and
  # then removing it from the pool. Attempting to checkout a connection after
  # shutdown will raise +ConnectionPool::PoolShuttingDownError+.

# conn = ts.pop
