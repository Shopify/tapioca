#
# Class **ERB** (the name stands for **Embedded Ruby**)
# is an easy-to-use, but also very powerful, [template processor][template processor].
#
# ## Usage
#
# Before you can use \ERB, you must first require it
# (examples on this page assume that this has been done):
#
# ```
# require 'erb'
# ```
#
# ## In Brief
#
# Here's how \ERB works:
#
# - You can create a *template*: a plain-text string that includes specially formatted *tags*..
# - You can create an \ERB object to store the template.
# - You can call instance method ERB#result to get the *result*.
#
# \ERB supports tags of three kinds:
#
# - [Expression tags][expression tags]:
#   each begins with `'<%='`, ends with `'%>'`; contains a Ruby expression;
#   in the result, the value of the expression replaces the entire tag:
#
#         template = 'The magic word is <%= magic_word %>.'
#         erb = ERB.new(template)
#         magic_word = 'xyzzy'
#         erb.result(binding) # => "The magic word is xyzzy."
#
#     The above call to #result passes argument `binding`,
#     which contains the binding of variable `magic_word` to its string value `'xyzzy'`.
#
#     The below call to #result need not pass a binding,
#     because its expression `Date::DAYNAMES` is globally defined.
#
#         ERB.new('Today is <%= Date::DAYNAMES[Date.today.wday] %>.').result # => "Today is Monday."
#
# - [Execution tags][execution tags]:
#   each begins with `'<%'`, ends with `'%>'`; contains Ruby code to be executed:
#
#          template = '<% File.write("t.txt", "Some stuff.") %>'
#          ERB.new(template).result
#          File.read('t.txt') # => "Some stuff."
#
# - [Comment tags][comment tags]:
#   each begins with `'<%#'`, ends with `'%>'`; contains comment text;
#   in the result, the entire tag is omitted.
#
#          template = 'Some stuff;<%# Note to self: figure out what the stuff is. %> more stuff.'
#          ERB.new(template).result # => "Some stuff; more stuff."
#
# ## Some Simple Examples
#
# Here's a simple example of \ERB in action:
#
# ```
# template = 'The time is <%= Time.now %>.'
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# erb.result
# # => "The time is 2025-09-09 10:49:26 -0500."
# ```
#
# Details:
#
# 1. A plain-text string is assigned to variable `template`.
#    Its embedded [expression tag][expression tags] `'<%= Time.now %>'` includes a Ruby expression, `Time.now`.
# 2. The string is put into a new \ERB object, and stored in variable `erb`.
# 4. Method call `erb.result` generates a string that contains the run-time value of `Time.now`,
#    as computed at the time of the call.
#
# The
# \ERB object may be re-used:
#
# ```
# erb.result
# # => "The time is 2025-09-09 10:49:33 -0500."
# ```
#
# Another example:
#
# ```
# template = 'The magic word is <%= magic_word %>.'
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# magic_word = 'abracadabra'
# erb.result(binding)
# # => "The magic word is abracadabra."
# ```
#
# Details:
#
# 1. As before, a plain-text string is assigned to variable `template`.
#    Its embedded [expression tag][expression tags] `'<%= magic_word %>'` has a variable *name*, `magic_word`.
# 2. The string is put into a new \ERB object, and stored in variable `erb`;
#    note that `magic_word` need not be defined before the \ERB object is created.
# 3. `magic_word = 'abracadabra'` assigns a value to variable `magic_word`.
# 4. Method call `erb.result(binding)` generates a string
#    that contains the *value* of `magic_word`.
#
# As before, the \ERB object may be re-used:
#
# ```
# magic_word = 'xyzzy'
# erb.result(binding)
# # => "The magic word is xyzzy."
# ```
#
# ## Bindings
#
# A call to method #result, which produces the formatted result string,
# requires a [Binding object][binding object] as its argument.
#
# The binding object provides the bindings for expressions in [expression tags][expression tags].
#
# There are three ways to provide the required binding:
#
# - [Default binding][default binding].
# - [Local binding][local binding].
# - [Augmented binding][augmented binding]
#
# ### Default Binding
#
# When you pass no `binding` argument to method #result,
# the method uses its default binding: the one returned by method #new_toplevel.
# This binding has the bindings defined by Ruby itself,
# which are those for Ruby's constants and variables.
#
# That binding is sufficient for an expression tag that refers only to Ruby's constants and variables;
# these expression tags refer only to Ruby's global constant `RUBY_COPYRIGHT` and global variable `$0`:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# The Ruby copyright is <%= RUBY_COPYRIGHT.inspect %>.
# The current process is <%= $0 %>.
# TEMPLATE
# puts ERB.new(template).result
# The Ruby copyright is "ruby - Copyright (C) 1993-2025 Yukihiro Matsumoto".
# The current process is irb.
# ```
#
# (The current process is `irb` because that's where we're doing these examples!)
#
# ### Local Binding
#
# The default binding is *not* sufficient for an expression
# that refers to a a constant or variable that is not defined there:
#
# ```
# Foo = 1 # Defines local constant Foo.
# foo = 2 # Defines local variable foo.
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# The current value of constant Foo is <%= Foo %>.
# The current value of variable foo is <%= foo %>.
# The Ruby copyright is <%= RUBY_COPYRIGHT.inspect %>.
# The current process is <%= $0 %>.
# TEMPLATE
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# ```
#
# This call below raises `NameError` because although `Foo` and `foo` are defined locally,
# they are not defined in the default binding:
#
# ```
# erb.result # Raises NameError.
# ```
#
# To make the locally-defined constants and variables available,
# you can call #result with the local binding:
#
# ```
# puts erb.result(binding)
# The current value of constant Foo is 1.
# The current value of variable foo is 2.
# The Ruby copyright is "ruby - Copyright (C) 1993-2025 Yukihiro Matsumoto".
# The current process is irb.
# ```
#
# ### Augmented Binding
#
# Another way to make variable bindings (but not constant bindings) available
# is to use method #result_with_hash(hash);
# the passed hash has name/value pairs that are to be used to define and assign variables
# in a copy of the default binding:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# The current value of variable bar is <%= bar %>.
# The current value of variable baz is <%= baz %>.
# The Ruby copyright is <%= RUBY_COPYRIGHT.inspect %>.
# The current process is <%= $0 %>.
# TEMPLATE
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# ```
#
# Both of these calls raise `NameError`, because `bar` and `baz`
# are not defined in either the default binding or the local binding.
#
# ```
# puts erb.result          # Raises NameError.
# puts erb.result(binding) # Raises NameError.
# ```
#
# This call passes a hash that causes `bar` and `baz` to be defined
# in a new binding (derived from #new_toplevel):
#
# ```
# hash = {bar: 3, baz: 4}
# puts erb.result_with_hash(hash)
# The current value of variable bar is 3.
# The current value of variable baz is 4.
# The Ruby copyright is "ruby - Copyright (C) 1993-2025 Yukihiro Matsumoto".
# The current process is irb.
# ```
#
# ## Tags
#
# The examples above use expression tags.
# These are the tags available in \ERB:
#
# - [Expression tag][expression tags]: the tag contains a Ruby expression;
#   in the result, the entire tag is to be replaced with the run-time value of the expression.
# - [Execution tag][execution tags]: the tag contains Ruby code;
#   in the result, the entire tag is to be replaced with the run-time value of the code.
# - [Comment tag][comment tags]: the tag contains comment code;
#   in the result, the entire tag is to be omitted.
#
# ### Expression Tags
#
# You can embed a Ruby expression in a template using an *expression tag*.
#
# Its syntax is `<%= _expression_ %>`,
# where *expression* is any valid Ruby expression.
#
# When you call method #result,
# the method evaluates the expression and replaces the entire expression tag with the expression's value:
#
# ```
# ERB.new('Today is <%= Date::DAYNAMES[Date.today.wday] %>.').result
# # => "Today is Monday."
# ERB.new('Tomorrow will be <%= Date::DAYNAMES[Date.today.wday + 1] %>.').result
# # => "Tomorrow will be Tuesday."
# ERB.new('Yesterday was <%= Date::DAYNAMES[Date.today.wday - 1] %>.').result
# # => "Yesterday was Sunday."
# ```
#
# Note that whitespace before and after the expression
# is allowed but not required,
# and that such whitespace is stripped from the result.
#
# ```
# ERB.new('My appointment is on <%=Date::DAYNAMES[Date.today.wday + 2]%>.').result
# # => "My appointment is on Wednesday."
# ERB.new('My appointment is on <%=     Date::DAYNAMES[Date.today.wday + 2]    %>.').result
# # => "My appointment is on Wednesday."
# ```
#
# ### Execution Tags
#
# You can embed Ruby executable code in template using an *execution tag*.
#
# Its syntax is `<% _code_ %>`,
# where *code* is any valid Ruby code.
#
# When you call method #result,
# the method executes the code and removes the entire execution tag
# (generating no text in the result):
#
# ```
# ERB.new('foo <% Dir.chdir("C:/") %> bar').result # => "foo  bar"
# ```
#
# Whitespace before and after the embedded code is optional:
#
# ```
# ERB.new('foo <%Dir.chdir("C:/")%> bar').result   # => "foo  bar"
# ```
#
# You can interleave text with execution tags to form a control structure
# such as a conditional, a loop, or a `case` statements.
#
# Conditional:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <% if verbosity %>
# An error has occurred.
# <% else %>
# Oops!
# <% end %>
# TEMPLATE
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# verbosity = true
# erb.result(binding)
# # => "\nAn error has occurred.\n\n"
# verbosity = false
# erb.result(binding)
# # => "\nOops!\n\n"
# ```
#
# Note that the interleaved text may itself contain expression tags:
#
# Loop:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <% Date::ABBR_DAYNAMES.each do |dayname| %>
# <%= dayname %>
# <% end %>
# TEMPLATE
# ERB.new(template).result
# # => "\nSun\n\nMon\n\nTue\n\nWed\n\nThu\n\nFri\n\nSat\n\n"
# ```
#
# Other, non-control, lines of Ruby code may be interleaved with the text,
# and the Ruby code may itself contain regular Ruby comments:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <% 3.times do %>
# <%= Time.now %>
# <% sleep(1) # Let's make the times different. %>
# <% end %>
# TEMPLATE
# ERB.new(template).result
# # => "\n2025-09-09 11:36:02 -0500\n\n\n2025-09-09 11:36:03 -0500\n\n\n2025-09-09 11:36:04 -0500\n\n\n"
# ```
#
# The execution tag may also contain multiple lines of code:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <%
#   (0..2).each do |i|
#     (0..2).each do |j|
# %>
# * <%=i%>,<%=j%>
# <%
#     end
#   end
# %>
# TEMPLATE
# ERB.new(template).result
# # => "\n* 0,0\n\n* 0,1\n\n* 0,2\n\n* 1,0\n\n* 1,1\n\n* 1,2\n\n* 2,0\n\n* 2,1\n\n* 2,2\n\n"
# ```
#
# #### Shorthand Format for Execution Tags
#
# You can use keyword argument `trim_mode: '%'` to enable a shorthand format for execution tags;
# this example uses the shorthand format `% _code_` instead of `<% _code_ %>`:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# % priorities.each do |priority|
#   * <%= priority %>
# % end
# TEMPLATE
# erb = ERB.new(template, trim_mode: '%')
# priorities = [ 'Run Ruby Quiz',
#                'Document Modules',
#                'Answer Questions on Ruby Talk' ]
# puts erb.result(binding)
#   * Run Ruby Quiz
#   * Document Modules
#   * Answer Questions on Ruby Talk
# ```
#
# Note that in the shorthand format, the character `'%'` must be the first character in the code line
# (no leading whitespace).
#
# #### Suppressing Unwanted Blank Lines
#
# With keyword argument `trim_mode` not given,
# all blank lines go into the result:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <% if true %>
# <%= RUBY_VERSION %>
# <% end %>
# TEMPLATE
# ERB.new(template).result.lines.each {|line| puts line.inspect }
# "\n"
# "3.4.5\n"
# "\n"
# ```
#
# You can give `trim_mode: '-'`, you can suppress each blank line
# whose source line ends with `-%>` (instead of `%>`):
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <% if true -%>
# <%= RUBY_VERSION %>
# <% end -%>
# TEMPLATE
# ERB.new(template, trim_mode: '-').result.lines.each {|line| puts line.inspect }
# "3.4.5\n"
# ```
#
# It is an error to use the trailing `'-%>'` notation without `trim_mode: '-'`:
#
# ```
# ERB.new(template).result.lines.each {|line| puts line.inspect } # Raises SyntaxError.
# ```
#
# #### Suppressing Unwanted Newlines
#
# Consider this template:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <% RUBY_VERSION %>
# <%= RUBY_VERSION %>
# foo <% RUBY_VERSION %>
# foo <%= RUBY_VERSION %>
# TEMPLATE
# ```
#
# With keyword argument `trim_mode` not given, all newlines go into the result:
#
# ```
# ERB.new(template).result.lines.each {|line| puts line.inspect }
# "\n"
# "3.4.5\n"
# "foo \n"
# "foo 3.4.5\n"
# ```
#
# You can give `trim_mode: '>'` to suppress the trailing newline
# for each line that ends with `'%>'` (regardless of its beginning):
#
# ```
# ERB.new(template, trim_mode: '>').result.lines.each {|line| puts line.inspect }
# "3.4.5foo foo 3.4.5"
# ```
#
# You can give `trim_mode: '<>'` to suppress the trailing newline
# for each line that both begins with `'<%'` and ends with `'%>'`:
#
# ```
# ERB.new(template, trim_mode: '<>').result.lines.each {|line| puts line.inspect }
# "3.4.5foo \n"
# "foo 3.4.5\n"
# ```
#
# #### Combining Trim Modes
#
# You can combine certain trim modes:
#
# - `'%-'`: Enable shorthand and omit each blank line ending with `'-%>'`.
# - `'%>'`: Enable shorthand and omit newline for each line ending with `'%>'`.
# - `'%<>'`: Enable shorthand and omit newline for each line starting with `'<%'` and ending with `'%>'`.
#
# ### Comment Tags
#
# You can embed a comment in a template using a *comment tag*;
# its syntax is `<%# _text_ %>`,
# where *text* is the text of the comment.
#
# When you call method #result,
# it removes the entire comment tag
# (generating no text in the result).
#
# Example:
#
# ```
# template = 'Some stuff;<%# Note to self: figure out what the stuff is. %> more stuff.'
# ERB.new(template).result # => "Some stuff; more stuff."
# ```
#
# A comment tag may appear anywhere in the template.
#
# Note that the beginning of the tag must be `'<%#'`, not `'<% #'`.
#
# In this example, the tag begins with `'<% #'`, and so is an execution tag, not a comment tag;
# the cited code consists entirely of a Ruby-style comment (which is of course ignored):
#
# ```
# ERB.new('Some stuff;<% # Note to self: figure out what the stuff is. %> more stuff.').result
# # => "Some stuff;"
# ```
#
# ## Encodings
#
# An \ERB object has an [encoding][encoding],
# which is by default the encoding of the template string;
# the result string will also have that encoding.
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <%# Comment. %>
# TEMPLATE
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# template.encoding   # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
# erb.encoding        # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
# erb.result.encoding # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
# ```
#
# You can specify a different encoding by adding a [magic comment][magic comments]
# at the top of the given template:
#
# ```
# template = <<TEMPLATE
# <%#-*- coding: Big5 -*-%>
# <%# Comment. %>
# TEMPLATE
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# template.encoding   # => #<Encoding:UTF-8>
# erb.encoding        # => #<Encoding:Big5>
# erb.result.encoding # => #<Encoding:Big5>
# ```
#
# ## Error Reporting
#
# Consider this template (containing an error):
#
# ```
# template = '<%= nosuch %>'
# erb = ERB.new(template)
# ```
#
# When \ERB reports an error,
# it includes a file name (if available) and a line number;
# the file name comes from method #filename, the line number from method #lineno.
#
# Initially, those values are `nil` and `0`, respectively;
# these initial values are reported as `'(erb)'` and `1`, respectively:
#
# ```
# erb.filename # => nil
# erb.lineno   # => 0
# erb.result
# (erb):1:in '<main>': undefined local variable or method 'nosuch' for main (NameError)
# ```
#
# You can use methods #filename= and #lineno= to assign values
# that are more meaningful in your context:
#
# ```
# erb.filename = 't.txt'
# erb.lineno = 555
# erb.result
# t.txt:556:in '<main>': undefined local variable or method 'nosuch' for main (NameError)
# ```
#
# You can use method #location= to set both values:
#
# ```
# erb.location = ['u.txt', 999]
# erb.result
# u.txt:1000:in '<main>': undefined local variable or method 'nosuch' for main (NameError)
# ```
#
# ## Plain Text with Embedded Ruby
#
# Here's a plain-text template;
# it uses the literal notation `'%q{ ... }'` to define the template
# (see [%q literals][%q literals]);
# this avoids problems with backslashes.
#
# ```
# template = %q{

# ## HTML with Embedded Ruby
#
# This example shows an HTML template.
#
# First, here's a custom class, `Product`:
#
# ```
# class Product
#   def initialize(code, name, desc, cost)
#     @code = code
#     @name = name
#     @desc = desc
#     @cost = cost
#     @features = []
#   end
#
#   def add_feature(feature)
#     @features << feature
#   end
#
#   # Support templating of member data.
#   def get_binding
#     binding
#   end
#
# end
# ```
#
# The template below will need these values:
#
# ```
# toy = Product.new('TZ-1002',
#                   'Rubysapien',
#                   "Geek's Best Friend!  Responds to Ruby commands...",
#                   999.95

# ## Other Template Processors
#
# Various Ruby projects have their own template processors.
# The Ruby Processing System [RDoc][rdoc], for example, has one that can be used elsewhere.
#
# Other popular template processors may found in the [Template Engines][template engines] page

  # For details about `template`, its embedded tags, and generated results, see ERB.
  #
  # **Keyword Argument `trim_mode`**
  #
  # You can use keyword argument `trim_mode: '%'`
  # to enable the [shorthand format][shorthand format] for execution tags.
  #
  # This value allows [blank line control][blank line control]:
  #
  # - `'-'`: Omit each blank line ending with `'%>'`.
  #
  # Other values allow [newline control][newline control]:
  #
  # - `'>'`: Omit newline for each line ending with `'%>'`.
  # - `'<>'`: Omit newline for each line starting with `'<%'` and ending with `'%>'`.
  #
  # You can also [combine trim modes][combine trim modes].
  #
  # **Keyword Argument `eoutvar`**
  #
  # The string value of keyword argument `eoutvar` specifies the name of the variable
  # that method #result uses to construct its result string;
  # see #src.
  #
  # This is useful when you need to run multiple \ERB templates through the same binding
  # and/or when you want to control where output ends up.
  #
  # It's good practice to choose a variable name that begins with an underscore: `'_'`.

# ERB::Compiler
#
# Compiles ERB templates into Ruby code; the compiled code produces the
# template result when evaluated. ERB::Compiler provides hooks to define how
# generated output is handled.
#
# Internally ERB does something like this to generate the code returned by
# ERB#src:
#
#   compiler = ERB::Compiler.new('<>')
#   compiler.pre_cmd    = ["_erbout=+''"]
#   compiler.put_cmd    = "_erbout.<<"
#   compiler.insert_cmd = "_erbout.<<"
#   compiler.post_cmd   = ["_erbout"]
#
#   code, enc = compiler.compile("Got <%= obj %>!\n")
#   puts code
#
# <i>Generates</i>:
#
#   #coding:UTF-8
#   _erbout=+''; _erbout.<< "Got ".freeze; _erbout.<<(( obj ).to_s); _erbout.<< "!\n".freeze; _erbout
#
# By default the output is sent to the print method.  For example:
#
#   compiler = ERB::Compiler.new('<>')
#   code, enc = compiler.compile("Got <%= obj %>!\n")
#   puts code
#
# <i>Generates</i>:
#
#   #coding:UTF-8
#   print "Got ".freeze; print(( obj ).to_s); print "!\n".freeze
#
# == Evaluation
#
# The compiled code can be used in any context where the names in the code
# correctly resolve. Using the last example, each of these print 'Got It!'
#
# Evaluate using a variable:
#
#   obj = 'It'
#   eval code
#
# Evaluate using an input:
#
#   mod = Module.new
#   mod.module_eval %{
#     def get(obj)
#       #{code}
#     end
#   }
#   extend mod
#   get('It')
#
# Evaluate using an accessor:
#
#   klass = Class.new Object
#   klass.class_eval %{
#     attr_accessor :obj
#     def initialize(obj)
#       @obj = obj
#     end
#     def get_it
#       #{code}
